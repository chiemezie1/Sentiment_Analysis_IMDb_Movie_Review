      "Review Text: Capitalizing on two \"hot\" properties of the early sixties, director Robert Wise and the infinitely talented Julie Andrews, this film delivers some pure cinematic magic like none before it nor since, especially the sequences which feature the songs \"Do Re Mi\" (#88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time) through the streets of Salzburg and \"The Lonely Goatherd\", performed with puppets.These, among others, helped it capture the Best Picture Oscar that year over David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), Stanley Kramer's Ship of Fools (1965), A Thousand Clowns (1965), and Darling (1965), which (like Doctor Zhivago (1965), also) features Julie Christie, in her Oscar winning Best Actress performance. Wise, who would later receive the Irving G. Thalberg Award from the Academy, picked up his second Best Director Oscar for this film; Andrews her second consecutive Best Actress nomination (she'd won for her film debut in Mary Poppins (1964)).Written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (and Maria von Trapp's novel), Ernest Lehman's screenplay tells the story of the Austrian von Trapp family who, after their first public performance as a singing group, fled when Hitler annexed their country (the Anschluss) in March, 1938. The real von Trapp family had performed all over Europe because Maria, with the help of a local priest (fashioned as Max Detweiler, played by Richard Haydn, in the film), had turned the family's hobby into a profession when an Austrian bank crash caused Georg to lose his fortune.Though this musical is almost three hours in length, the plot interspersed with magnificent Rodgers & Hammerstein songs (helping the film to win the Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment) keep it from feeling overlong.In fact, it's the kind of film, like The Wizard of Oz (1939), that one can watch every year and never tire of it. The title song is #10 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time; \"My Favorite Things\" is #64. And no one can forget (how do you solve a problem like) \"Maria\", sung in part by Marni Nixon (known for dubbing Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn in The King and I (1956), West Side Story (1961), and My Fair Lady (1964), respectively) in one of her only on-screen appearances as Sister Sophia ... or \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\", \"Edelweiss\" and \"So Long, Farewell\", especially little Kym Karath's \"goodbye\" in the reprise, as the seven year old Gretl. Each of these tunes, and their just right lyrics, move the story along such that one never has cause to look at one's watch to wonder \"when will it end?\". The film's Sound and Editing, as evidenced in the aforementioned \"Do Re Mi\" and \"The Lonely Goatherd\" numbers, also won Academy Awards.Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is terrific as the stern aristocrat widower who marries his governess after she, and his children, had helped the Captain to rediscover song, love, and what it means to be a father. The cast of kids is marvelous, the most recognizable of which is Angela Cartwright as Brigitta, who would go on to star in the TV series Lost in Space that same year. Nicholas Hammond, Friedrich, also had a television career which included playing roles in several series, most notably as Spiderman. Heather Menzies's (Louisa) TV career was shorter. Charmian Carr gives a strong performance as the eldest child Liesl who's \"Sixteen going on Seventeen\". Peggy Wood's head Mother Abbess (whose singing voice was dubbed by Margery McKay) earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Her best line \"Him?!\", after which she immediately excuses Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), when Maria is telling her why she's returned to the abbey.I also especially like the \"dueling\" Sisters, Margaretta and Berthe (Portia Nelson) who, despite their disparate feelings towards Maria's suitability as a nun, work together to foil the Nazis in the end. Ben Wright plays a credible Herr Zeller. The recognizable Norma Varden is Frau Schmidt, the von Trapp's housekeeper. And to have the great Eleanor Parker in a supporting role as the Baroness, who presumably doesn't sing or perform (she that forgot her harmonica), such ironic and fortunate casting! Also, Maria von Trapp herself appears briefly, uncredited, during the \"I Have Confidence\" number.The film's Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Cinematography, Costume Design also received Oscar nominations. Plus, besides being added to the National Film Registry in 2001, the film is #55 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list and #27 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. #41 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list. #4 on AFI's 25 Greatest Movie Musicals list.One of the best family movie night film's ever made, make it an annual tradition in yours!\n",

      "Review Text: Sound of Music is one of the best musicals of all time displaying one of the greatest voices to ever be heard on the silver screen: Julie Andrews. What a wonderful movie that not only I grew up with but still treasure to this day. Sound of Music has everything you could ask for: romance, humor, singing, dancing and a wonderful cast that put their heart and soul into this film. All the songs are recognizable, although I admit that still hearing \"Few Favorite Things\" is strange during Christmas time. But moving on, Sound of Music is a classic film that is still incredible to watch and I always enjoy slipping into my DVD player to this day.Maria, a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows, the Mother Superior sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof, and his seven children virtual automatons-at least, whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise, the kids are holy terrors, as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children, especially oldest daughter Liesl, who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain, she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness. But the children insist that Maria return, the Baroness steps out of the picture, and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song \"Something Good.\" Unhappily, they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already, swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home, and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the \"glories\" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism, and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.Julie Andrews had come off fresh from Mary Poppins, which her character wasn't that far from being the nanny caring for children with a stuffy father. But the thing that made this film so special is that you honestly feel the love between Maria and Von Trapp, what a wonderful love story they had. The film is a bit long, but back in the day they had intermissions and oh, boy do I miss that. Come on, Lord of the Rings could have used one of those lol. Back onto Sound of Music, my favorite song is probably \"Confidence in Me\", such life to it due to Julie's beautiful voice and her dancing along the sidewalk could make anyone want to do the same thing. I love The Sound of Music, my boyfriend who hates musicals and said this was the crown of the worst, I asked him to watch it with me to see if he would give it another chance, I glanced over to see him singing a little to the songs! He finally admitted that the songs are very catchy, so see? You can find any little positive thing to say about this film, The Sound of Music brings you to life and you can't help but fall in love with this spectacular musical.10/10\n",

      "Review Text: *** This review may contain spoilers ***A few days ago I was thinking,\"What Best Picutre winner should I choose for a review?\" Many to choose from of course.The answer came to me when I chose to & replayed\n",
      "this wonderful film since it had been a few years since seeing it.I recall on The Oprah Winfrey Show ,she had Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all 7 of the, now grown, child actors who played the Von Trapp children. It was the first time they'd all been together in one place since 1965 and it was a very touching reunion.Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, The Sound Of Music was on TV every year and when you're a kid, it usually is the first \"Best Picture\" Oscar winner that you ever see in your life, without even knowing it.When you see it the first time, the moment you see Andrews in the hills and that sweeping camera shot, you know it's going to be something great.Like many kids, it was only natural I'd like songs like \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"My Favorite Things\", \"So Long, Farewell\" and \"The Lonely Goatherd\" (or \"The Yodeling Song\" as some call it) and more. I liked \"Edelweiss\" and \"Climb Every Mountain\" but not until when I was older. It was on every year in our house.Julie Andrews' singing voice is no longer of this caliber but it's great that we have her in this and \"Mary Poppins\" and other movies, where we can marvel at her vocal abilities back then.Plummer turns in a somewhat serious but enjoyable performance. Going from stern and inflexible, then back to the father the children knew when their mother was alive, fair and loving and (of course) singing.Every kid has their own memorable moments as well The family's togetherness and fun is disrupted by the infiltration of the wretched Nazi party. They know they have to escape their own country now or live under the rule of a cruel & heartless dictatorship.That leads to the most exciting part of the movie. The clever departure after the concert, chase through the city and eventual escape over the mountains.The Sound Of Music, as we know, was a phenomenal success when it was released in March of 1965. It deservedly won for Best Picture and it's other categories.That success came about because it's simply a movie that the whole family and even those without families can enjoy. Which is why it's still so highly acclaimed even now .Lastly, because the people behind the scenes, as well as Andrews & Plummer themselves, made sure the film had an equal balance of fun and that of the serious as well. A job and movie, well doneSounds like ten stars, for all time. (END)\n",

      "Review Text: Let me confess I'm not a Catholic, I don't have children, I can't stand schmaltz and yet I love The Sound Of Music. I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: \"It makes you feel alive\" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you.\n",

      "Review Text: I know this movie is long, but it is a timeless musical nonetheless. The thing i loved most was the songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason why I love it is the magnificent performance of Julie Andrews as Maria, a young woman who wishes for a better life, I suppose. Maria is pretty, with a beautiful voice, mixed with brashness and sadness, all the qualities that Andrews gives to her performances. The only film she disappoints slightly in is Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as well as the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. i can't pick a favourite scene, but who can forget the opening and the \"Do ah Dear\" sequence? i also thought the children were sweet and the film had a number of clever subplots, like Liesels's secret love. 10/10 for a musical, that should be in the top 250. It was number 2 on the Greatest Musicals, losing out to Grease. Bethany Cox\n",

      "Review Text: \"The Sound of Music\" is an impressive musical that stands above other films of the genre because of interesting characters, top-notch direction, and a truly inspired screenplay.  Julie Andrews (Oscar-nominated) stars as the young nun who leaves the convent to become the governess to a large family. She is instantly at odds with the children's father (Christopher Plummer), but they soon fall in love and get married.  However, evil forces lurk overhead as the Nazis invade their homeland of Austria.  Somewhat based on a true story, \"The Sound of Music\" is one of those rare musicals that works because there is a sense of fear and drama in the film's final act.  This makes the film believable and none of the musical numbers take away from the story or the film's direction.  5 stars out of 5.\n",

      "Review Text: A spirited nun leaves her convent and becomes a governess in pre-war Austria. Here she teaches the six children about love, life and music against the growing threat of Nazism.Your fingers hesitate on the keyboard before making comment on a film that is more a phenomena than a stretch of celluloid. This wasn't just a smash hit in the normal western markets - it also went huge everywhere and has stayed huge. The whole Indian film industry is descended from the template set down here.While this was a well regarded stage musical, this wasn't seen as a natural box office smash (a musical based on the life of a nun!) and was probably thrown to Robert Wise (more an action - than a music - man) because he was known for being able to operate well on a budget (all those B pics!)It was just as well, production was hellish: They had forgotten (didn't know?) how moody the European weather could be (even in Summer) and the genuine Austrian period folk songs didn't shine (new ones were quickly written); and beyond that many of the children had no real film acting experience.The success of the film is nothing but a bag of paradoxes, the must striking being that is was old fashioned even when it was released. Beat based pop music was dominating the sales charts and the sixties were beginning to swing. Hem lines were going up hair lines were going down and James Bond had already introduced casual sex and violence to the screen.This may have been made in 1965 - but it could easily have been made 20 years earlier and is the (off-screen) product of people that probably were coming to the end of their best creative period. Oscar and Hammerstein had already penned most of their famous musicals and must have been amazed that they struck their largest gold reserve so late in the day.As Noel Coward once observed, the one thing that critics overlook is that the public are looking for simple minded entertainment, not messages or meaning. And this is both simple minded and entertaining (if you can live with heavy schmaltz). There are certainly no messages, unless you need to be told that love and music are good and Nazi take-overs are bad!The songs don't so much act as light relief, but provide the film with a life support machine. As drama the whole thing can't get out of second gear - even the Nazi threat doesn't raise the drama level beyond village theatre. I also guess we are supposed to know what these people really represent from other sources?Julie Andrews performance is massively underrated. Here is someone that has to sing, dance and act with children (sometimes all at the same time!) and yet makes it look easy, natural and spontaneous. When has, say, Robert De Niro ever done anything as technically difficult as this?In many ways SOM is bullet proof (can you imagine Mel Brooks/Jerry Zucker doing a spoof?) family entertainment. A plot everyone can follow, charming children, excellent score, pretty scenery, perfect lead and a happy ending - if not for the rest of war torn Europe!As a footnote. Twentieth Century Fox lost all the profits they made on this film on musical follow ups that included Hello Dolly, Star and Dr Dolittle - which makes clear that the whole thing was, indeed, just a giant happy accident and musicals were not what the audience secretly wanted all along.\n",

      "Review Text: This review contains LOTS of spoilers. My advice is not to read my review at all, as it will no doubt hinder your enjoyment of this wonderful film! I mean it--DON'T READ ON.....I adored \"The Sound of Music\" when I saw it for the first time when I was 16. I loved the film and was completely infatuated with Julie Andrews. Frankly, this isn't at all surprising as practically EVERYONE was in love with Julie Andrews after they watched the film! What wasn't to like?! The music was AMAZING, the story very romantic and the film uplifting throughout. However, I made a mistake. I loved the film so much that I read up on the real Von Trappe family--and it was little like the wonderful family in the film! The Captain was actually always a pretty nice guy and Frauline Maria wasn't exactly 'practically perfect in every way'! To make things MUCH worse, I traveled to Salzburg, Austria several decades later--and I learned THE TRUTH!!! The wonderful Von Trappe home in the film was actually a composite of about a half dozen different homes in the area! The gazebo was miles from the riverfront which was miles from the interior of the Von Trappe home--and the truth got worse! When we visited the cemetery where the family hid out at the end of the film, we were shocked (and VERY offended) at a memorial in this cemetery for the SS--the same folks that manned the death camps! All in all, this is a case where the truth really, really hurt. And, although I am a history teacher who loves historical accuracy, this is a case where I wish I'd never learned the truth. Heck, at the end of the film, you see the family escaping over the Alps to freedom--and in real life, they just took a train to Italy!! Hrmmph!!\n",

      "Review Text: If \"West Side Story\" was the best musical film of the sixties, then \"The Sound of Music,\" adapted from the long-running Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family, was certainly the most popularWith a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment (the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves), religion (in the Hollywood tradition of serene, kind nuns), romance (actually two romances, one adult, one adolescent), and anti-Nazi feeling (Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invaders)and with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid, conscientious craftsman and a fluent story-teller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions, \"The Sound of Music\" is perfect with its sumptuous location photography, immaculate, fluid editing, and splendid tonesThe film does have a justifiably famous opening: the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews, as mischievous, warmhearted Maria, exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley",
      " It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again, but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter (Charmian Carr) meets her shy beau (Daniel Truhitte) in the family garden, he sings \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" to her, and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo",
      " Maria's music lesson to the children, \"Do-Re-Mi,\" is beautifully staged, set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg, changing their clothing through camera wizardry",
      " And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest, \"Edelweiss,\" with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and HammersteinAnother of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and self-confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self-esteem... It works to balance the tight-lipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the \"adorable\" posturings of the children, and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness...\n",

The Sound Of Music did not only win the best original score, but along another nine academy awards. Best Picture, Best director, Best film editing, Best sound mixing, Best actress, Best supporting actress, Best cinematography, Best costume design, Best production design. \n",
      "The Sound of Music might be the most perceptible work of Robert Rise, Time Magazine described it as 'most popular attraction in the first half-century of the Hollywood feature film'. The justification is considerable. This movie does not forms part of this generation's childhood memories, but also brings fond memories for older generations.According to Sound Of Music Companion The story is based on the real life story of the Von Trapp Family singers. Originated in 1926 - Austria, Maria(Julie Andrews) arrived at the Trapp family as a private tutor for the family of 10 after leaving Nonnberg Abbey. She gradually got the children immersed into music and enticed them to sing but faced opposition from Baron Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) , their father. After Maria was sent back and forth from the Abbey, the father of 10 eventually had fallen in love with Maria and married her. The movie ends with the family fleeing when Hitler annexed their country, after participating in the Salzburg Festival Singing Competition.Sound wise, the original score from The Sound Of Music, might be the best film music soundtrack in cinema history. The songs \"My Favourite Thing\"and \"Do Re Mi\" is still ranked 66 and 88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time respectively .( AFI, no date) The composer Irwin Kostal has achieved his second academy award from the timeless classic film after Mary \n",

The Telegraph UK describes the voice of the cast as ' clear as a mountain stream and as pure as an angel ' .Besides, the cinematography of the The Sound Of Music is also notable : the infamous opening scene of the camera sweeping across the Austrian Alps to catch Maria singing title song as she is running through the bright green grassland is an example.The tone and mood of the movie may also be portrayed through different shots, especially the ending aerial shot with the Trapp family crossing the green hills to escape from Nazis with the song 'Climb Over Mountain' in the background.Matching the phenomenal shots, music and choreography together, The Sound of Music indisputably is a spectacular classical musical film.\n",

      "Review Text: The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name, with songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, which in return is based off, the memoir of Maria von Trapp, 'The Story of the Trapp Family Singers' in which two previous movies were made. 1956's the Von Trapp-Family & 1958's Von Trapp in America. This movie is very loosely based on true events, but it didn't stop from this beloved musical directed and written by Robert Wise to become a huge hit. The film tells the fictionalized love story of Maria Kutschera (Julie Andrews), a young Austrian postulant turn governess whom job is it, to tend to the seven children of the stern widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The children are uncooperative and the captain isn't much help, until Maria wins them over, sharing her love of music, but soon Nazi sympathizers, became to undermine her work, by moving into her beloved Austria and preparing to take over. Can the Von Trapp's family escape or will the Nazis destroy everything, she has work for? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film. The movie seem like it was trying really hard to mirror, the same success as Julie Andrew's previous film, 1964's Mary Poppins by having a similar plot-line. Both movies have a stern disciplinarian father figure that was turned around by a musician gifted nanny. In my opinion, I don't felt like it was a rip-off, because Mary Poppins goes into a more magical journey; while the Sound of Music is a bit more grounded and realistic. While, I like both films, I think the Sound of Music is way better than Poppins. While, the movie is set in the 1930s, Julie Andrew's character is an example of the ever changing woman of the 1960s. She's more open in challenging the standards gender expectations of a woman and how mother should acted. While she's acts like a mother figure, unharness, liberate mindsets and attitudes of the emotionally neglected children. Unlike Julie Andrew's character in Mary Poppins, Maria is more careless and youthful in her actions. She means well, but she tend to become troublesome, due to her challenging the brooding, dignified lifestyle of the times. She willing to challenge the narrow-thinking parenting approach on how the children, should be raise and be more fun-like when doing it. Julie Andrews's character holds this film together. She's convincing, as both the free spirited wild child and semi-authority figure in this film. It's easy to see why so many moviegoers find her as a good mother figure, lover or friend all rolled into one. Meanwhile, Christopher Plummer is spectacular as Captain von Trapp. He played the character who proves to be the film's hard rock. He keeps it solid and grounded between saccharine romance and compelling drama. While, he dislike making the film, his riveting performance feels so believable that you can see him, turn the hardened captain to loving husband and father. He was never too mean, that you couldn't find him likable. While, the movie makes him, mean. Georg von Trapp in real life was pretty outgoing and was the one whom taught the children music. Both parents depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living and why both really got married. Despite that, it kinda work. The children were pretty good in their acting and very cute, but there were too many of them to remember. The only one that had a sub-plot story, was Liesl (Charmian Carr). I enjoys the romantic duet \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" about her. Without spoiling it, her love affect with the post-boy was very shocking and heart breaking. The music in the film are some of the best ever from a musical. The movie is filled with memorable glorious songs like \"Do-Re-Mi,\" \"Climb Every Mountain\", \"Maria\", \"Lonely Goatherd\", \"My Favorite Things,\" \"Edelweiss, \"So Long, Farewell\" and others. I love the way, each song was reused in different ways in reprises. Other songs like \"Something Good,\" needed some more work. Glad, they eliminated, the not so good songs, \"How Can Love Survive\" and \"No Way to Stop It. The way, the movie is shot is beautiful to watch. The opening shot of the movie of the ALPS mountain range is breath-taking. The movie makes great use of the locations in Austria. It's really hard to find faults in this film. Some critics say the movie is a bit off putting cheery and dated, even in its darkness moments, but in my opinion, I think it does a good job bringing heavy realism. A lot of people might hate its pacing. After all, it's nearly 3 hours. Did we really need the 3rd act? Controversy surrounded the film's release in Germany & Austria, where the film's Nazi overtones brought about the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act due to the laws. The American studio forced the third act to be restored to the German release, which kinda anger people. In my opinion, the whole 3rd act with the Nazis wasn't needed. It really didn't play out like that in real life, nor did it had much music. Most of it was there to offset the general joviality of the first 2 acts. I don't mind, that it's there, but I can see why some people think it's seem out of place, even with the foreshadowing in the first two acts. After all, if you take it, away, you still have a pretty good film. Despite that, I really didn't see much to hate about the film. After all, the film went on to win Academy Awards. It even got selected for film preservation in the National Film Registry. It's also nice to see the movie get newly restored DVDs every ten years. Overall: It's engaging, inspirational and cute. It's a must watch. The ultimate family movie.\n",

      "Review Text: The scenery of the opening scene and the way it's shot and sung by Julie Andrews is very beautiful and magnificent. Not only is the music creative in this movie, but you feel the weight of it as the story progresses, specifically with the rise of Nazism during that time and place in Europe. Toward the end it's a lot like a horror movie with the tenseness and the way it's directed and I always was on the edge of my seat when that moment came around with Rolfe almost getting the family caught. I'd say this movie is good for most audiences and while it's a bit old-fashioned, it still feels like a culturally significant film.\n",

The choreography is also spectacular.Also a great placed Intermission Card (Something that should should be in movies over 150 minutes now)Then it ends with a great mid 60's style escape from the Nazis.I think anyone who tells you they don't like this has not actually watched it from start to finish and are just judging it on the clips.\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music (1965): Dir: Robert Wise / Cast: Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Richard Haydn, Peggy Wood: Wondrous expression of peace within darkness. Set in 1938 with the Nazis closing in on Austria, the story centres on free spirited Maria whom the nuns fear doesn't quite fit in. She is sent to oversee the seven children of former Naval officer Captain von Trapp. He is a widow who uses strict military discipline on the children, who respond by rebelling against every nanny hired. Maria holds strong allowing her friendly patient demeanor to win the children over. Eventually von Trapp is also won over when he overhears her influence through his children singing a song she taught them. They are soon sought after to sing at an event that has Nazis in attendance. Wonderful music full of life and joy, flawed only by the underdeveloped personalities of the children. Robert Wise previously had musical success with West Side Story but goes beyond that here. As in Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews shines as a nanny but of a different nature here. Christopher Plummer as von Trapp learns the importance of family. Eleanor Parker plays a wealthy potential wife to von Trapp. Richard Haydn plays an uncle arranging a play, and Peggy Wood plays the head nun. Theme demonstrates the ability to prevail through harsh times when the sound of music conquers opposing factors. Score: 9 / 10\n",

I don't believe the film would be as good without her, she is perfectly suited to the role. Most of the child acting is decent, which can usually really impact a film.The songs are absolutely classics and for a good reason. All further the story and fit, and they must have great song writers. Also, the settings are phenomenal with the mountain being iconic scenery now. Costumes are very nice, and reflect the mood of the scenes. However, the cinematography is basic but I think it is mainly due to the time period and equipment.Just overall an amazing classic that everyone has watched or needs to!\n",

The orchestration and cinematography. They are all perfect. There is nothing I would want to change in this movie. And I can watch this over and over again, year after year.The story of a would-be nun tasked to be a governess of the seven children of a naval officer is based on the autobiography of Maria von Trapp. The screenplay sometimes departed from real-life events, but I don't mind. I enjoy both fiction and nonfiction and consider The Sound Of Music a hybrid of these two genres. This captivating musical about love, hope and faith has entertained and inspired millions of viewers all over the world since it was released in 1965.\n",

Movies today....C.G.I. and Romantic Comedies in particular....are not in the least entertaining. This movie is also called cheesy (parts of it are), but its Danish Blue cheese ...not the mild Cheddar of todays garbage. Hollywood now...churns out a good movie...about every few years. This was made in 1965...it made an absolute fortune. It was made in a time when \"musicals\" were very popular. This period ushered in a great 70s ...when brilliant movies were common place.

This is not a movie in which lust plays any part.I love the gentle parenting it shows. I love the obedient children it shows.Talking points: Young love - does it often last?

Andrews gives a dazzling performance as the spirited Maria who warms our hearts and takes us away into a lovely world of song and connects the viewers into the cinematic family. Her costar who was well chosen for the role of the stern, stoic and dashing Captain Van Trapp is Christopher Plummer who lights up the screen when he comes on. He seems cold and unlikable, but we soon grow to love him as Maria does. The film is full of wonderful and memorable songs like \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"My Favorite Things\" and \"Climb Every Mountain.\" Any musical fan should see this terrific film and fall in love with the majestic beauty this picture presents as you journey into those hills.\n",

      "Review Text: The only reason for watching again this 1965 musical was the new release of the Blu-Ray DVD. Having seen at a young age the wonderful Broadway production starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, the movie version that followed greatly enhanced a work, that in its own merit, didn't need any improvement. As directed by Robert Wise, right after his triumphant \"West Side Story\", we were stunned to see how the director had opened up the film by placing the action just where it was supposed to have been taken place, the cinematic and gorgeous Salzburg.The new version we just saw is as splendid as when the film was originally released, but somehow in second viewing, we started to notice how sadly it has aged. Our first impression was much better than on second viewing because the original seemed larger than life. In fact, our copy of the film, even with the fine restoration cannot compare with the sensation of watching in a wide screen, which we believe was at the old Roxy where it played for quite a long time. Those were the days of exclusive engagements and this film qualified for it big time! Julie Andrews was at one of the highest points of her career, and as Maria her contribution to the overall enjoyment is invaluable. Christopher Plummer was an ideal Capt. Von Trapp. Eleanor Parker's Baroness has enough parts of charm and bitchiness seeing her man stolen by a novice in charge of those brats she would have inherited had she married the Captain.The real star of this production was Salzburg, that beautiful Austrian city that has kept its charm throughout history and the surrounding countryside is breathtaking. The film owes a lot to its cinematographer Ted McCourd who captured the magnificent locale in such a loving way. The music of Rogers and Hammerstein blends well within the context of the picture. It is a tribute to Robert Wise this film has endured the passing of time.\n",

The filmography was spectacular with the mountain and castle scenes taking you're breathe away with its beauty. The lines were witty and well thought out, bringing a dry humor to the film. I loved how it slowly showed how Maria won the hearts of the kids, letting them be kids. Not over rushed or over done, the romantic story of Marie and the Captain was slowly and perfectly done with witty lines as Maria stood up to him without over doing it. But even so her not realizing that she was falling in love with him or the kids was the best part. Everything about the film was done so smoothly and perfectly giving you a quality picture for the entire family to enjoy.\n",

I thought, after previously buying this on BluRay and having it for some time without having watched it on BluRay, I thought it just perfect for that Sunday, February 2nd. (Oh, and in case you were wondering, my other yearly tradition was fulfilled earlier in the day when I watched Groundhog Day on BluRay.)Despite my intentions, i.e. replacing the \"manly man\" sports programme with a musical, this movie was an absolute JOY to watch. Every second, every frame, every scene, every song",
      "from beginning to end had be on the edge of my seat. (And yeah, I did sing out loud the songs.) Now, this is only my second time ever seeing this and I'll get into my first time many, many years ago later. So, it was almost like me seeing it for the first time, again.It did help that the BluRay transfer was nothing short of a miracle. It made it look pristine, brand new and possibly even better than its initial release nearly 50 years ago. (I say possibly since I wasn't around for its first run.) Every inch of the screen (and mind you, I don't even have a TV that can give me the best BluRay offers – 720dpi) was immaculate.But, then again, so was the movie. I am not one to look for flaws in this movie, but an hour in, I had to pause myself and think: this movie has no flaws. Everything worked. To put it in 2014 terms: Everything *was* awesome.That said, I will say this, despite me granting this 5/5 stars (or 10/10 on IMDb's scale) and calling it nothing short of a masterpiece, I guess there was one tiny bit where it slowed down, towards the end, when it got serious. It had to, so it's not necessarily a flaw, per se, but it also didn't necessarily mesh with the previous nearly 3 hours.Honestly, it pains me to say one word against this fine piece of art. It was so magical, so wonderful, even the thoughts going through my head as I write this are filled with joy. I loved this movie. The music, the acting, the surprises and the humor – and amazingly, there was a lot more than you would expect, especially jokes that hold up today.If you haven't heard the story by now, it was a story of a nun that didn't belong until she was assigned the status of governess of seven children of a widowed father pre-WWII in Austria. There, she warms their hearts, unfreezes the father's and discovers herself. We're just blessed to go along with her journey.I hope you've seen this movie before. If you have, see it again. If you haven't, you must see it. Above all else, to either group of individuals, go out and buy a BluRay player (assuming you haven't already) and then buy this movie. Even cold. Buy it on BluRay and relish in the beauty and wonder of The Sound of Music.* * * Final thoughts: I was born 9 years after this movie's release. Hard for me to believe that as I now think about it. I grew up, or at least into mid-teens, listening or hearing the songs from the soundtrack which I loved. I didn't necessarily associate the songs from the movie, untilI cannot remember when, but our local movie theatre chain here in Phoenix, AZ, Harkins, played this movie for twenty-five cents as some kind of anniversary of the movie theatre chain. (Prices from when both the movie and chain opened.) I thought: well, I've never seen it, it's considered a masterpiece and why not view it on the big screen for the first time?Almost immediately in the movie, during the opening credits, they play an instrumental medley of multiple of the movie's songs. I sat up instantly thinking \"Oh! I know that song! I didn't know it was in this!\" and repeated that thought a couple more times. It was then I was thoroughly excited to see the rest of the movie.While the movie, songs, etc, didn't disappoint, the print did. It was an original print filled with scratches, a pink tint – many discolored scenes and cuts. There was an unintentionally laugh out loud scene for me when Julie Andrews was on one side of the room and suddenly the movie jumped to her on the other side. I remember thinking: \"I didn't know they could teleport way back then!\"I gave the movie the strong benefit of the doubt (of the original print in the projection booth.) I really did like it a lot.Fast-forward maaaybeee two decades to two months ago today. I watched it for the second time. I don't want to say it was the perfect quality of the BluRay disc, but I fell in deep love with this movie more than I can express in these words above.The gorgeous disc did help, that is. And not every BluRay comes out half as good as this one did.So, please, if you're even remotely interested in this, or want to reclaim that initial feeling you got from your childhood seeing this, BUY THIS ON BLURAY. You will not regret it.\n",

      "Review Text: It has often been hailed as the greatest musical movie of all time, it has been on TV every year, especially at Christmas, and it remains one of the most seen films in cinema. Based on the memoir of real by Maria von Trapp, the story became a hit Broadway musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein (composer by Richard Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II), and then this highly entertaining film, from Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The Haunting). Basically, set in 1938, it opens in the hills of Austria with free-spirited young Austrian woman Maria (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dame Julie Andrews) singing (\"The Sound of Music\"). Maria is a studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg. The other nuns are concerned by her constant lateness (apart from meals) and lack of discipline ((\"How Do You Solve a Problem Like) \"Maria\"). The Mother Abbess (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Peggy Wood) sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) to be governess to his seven children. Maria is nervous on her journey to the Captain's home, but she tries to find her confidence (\"I Have Confidence\"). The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. The seven children are: 16-year-old Liesl (Charmian Carr), 14-year-old Friedrich (Nicholas Hammond), 13-year-old Louisa (Heather Menzies-Urich), 10-year-old Kurt (Duane Chase), 9-year-old Brigitta (Angela Cartwright), 7-year-old Marta (Debbie Turner), and 6-year-old Gretl (Kym Karath). Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl is at the beginning of her womanhood, and has feelings for Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte), one year older, who delivers messages to the Captain, they spend the evening together in the garden (\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\"). That night, the children are scared by the thunder and lightning during a storm, Maria sings a song to make them feel better (\"My Favourite Things\"). While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and she teaches them how to sing (\"Do-Re-Mi\"). The Captain returns to the villa with wealthy socialite Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker), and their mutual friend, \"Uncle\" Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn). They are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when they fall into the water. The Captain is displeased by his children's clothes and activities. Maria makes an impassioned appeal that he should get closer to his children, but in anger he orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologises to Maria and asks her to stay. Maria and the children next perform a puppet show for their father, the Baroness and Max (\"The Lonely Goatherd\"). Max is impressed by the children's singing and suggests entering them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain will not allow his children to sing in public. He does agree, however, to organise a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while formally dressed guests and dancing the waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt to dance, he cuts in and partners with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Before they go to bed, the children perform for the guests (\"So Long, Farewell\"). Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. The children travel to the abbey and try to see Maria to convince her to come back. Mother Abbess learns that Maria has secluded herself and been silent to avoid her feelings for the Captain. She encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life (\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\"). After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until a replacement governess can be found. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed. The Baroness realises that his true feelings are for Maria, and she also knows that she does not feel for him as she may have before, so they break off their engagement. The Captain finds Maria in the garden, tells her that the engagement is off, and they finally express their feelings (\"Something Good\") and embrace. The Captain and Maria are soon married. While they are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria is in the grip of the Nazis, the couple return to their home. Rolfe, who has been brainwashed by the Nazi movement, delivers a telegram to the Captain, informing him that he must report to serve in the Third Reich's navy. Strongly opposed to the Nazis, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. As the von Trapp family try to leave that night, they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts waiting outside the villa. When questioned by Gauleiter Hans Zeller (Ben Wright), the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them there, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night the family perform (including \"Edelweiss\") for the large audience. During their final number and after being announced as the winners, the von Trapp family slip away. They seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts arrive to search for them, and Rolfe momentarily lets his conscience get the better of him, allowing the family to escape. The family get away using the caretaker's car, and the soldiers are unable to follow them as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. Also starring Anna Lee as Sister Margaretta, Portia Nelson as Sister Berthe, Norma Varden as Frau Schmidt the housekeeper, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, Marni Nixon as Sister Sophia, and Evadne Baker as Sister Bernice. Andrews give a magnificent performance as the reluctant nun who finds her true calling, and Plummer is likeable as the initially stern but slowly enlightened father. This is a film that will has enthralled audiences from every generation, with its wonderful use of colours, its marvellous Austrian mountainous and village locations, and its magical selection of show tunes that have become singalong favourites. The last quarter of the film, with all the Nazis and the hunt for the family, is perhaps questionable and unnecessary, but apart from that, it is a perfectly pleasant, charming, and brilliantly heart-warming musical drama. Julie Andrews was number 6 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, \"Do Re Mi\" was number 88, \"My Favourite Things\" was number 64, and \"The Sound of Music\" was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 4 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, it was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 2 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 55 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Films, and it was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Outstanding!\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound Of Music. Everyone knows this movie/musical by now. You all know the songs,the story everything so why is this movie so popular,well for me its gotta be the songs as they as so memorable and entertaining.I happened to have watched this last night after a very long tie and let me tell ya I loved it.The Story is about a would be nun named Maria who is living in a convent with nuns(played by Julie Andrews) who becomes a governess,as the nuns wanted her to mind the Von Trapp family(led by Christopher Plummer who plays Captian Gaynor Von Trapp,who is a widowed father of 7 children). At first the Von Trapp children aren't too keen on Maria but once she teaches them how to sing and enjoy life they start to like her more including Captian Von Trapp himself. Of course the Capitan has to leave to Vienna (since the film is set in Austria)and Maria has to look after his children,but when the Capitan comes back he announces his engagement to the baroness(who in my opinion is a gold-digger). But when the Capitan later falls for Maria,things get complicated. So will the Captian change his mind on marrying the baroness and marry Maria instead and avoid the Nazzi's who are after the Von Trapp's.Bottom line I highly recommend this gem to everyone who loves musical's and let me say that this is way better than Into The Woods hands down. Also my favorite songs include The Sound Of Music,Do Ra Me,You are 16 going on 17,and that love ballad Maria and the Captian sing when they kiss for the first time as well as Climb Every Mountain.If you ever seen Vin Diesel's film The Pacifier they actually reference this movie which I thought was cool.Overall they just don't make movies like these anymore and if there was ever a remake of this movie to come out down the line I would love Lily James and Richard Madden to play Maria and Captian Von Trapp. I dunno why but I seen these guys in Cinderella and parts of the movie reminded me of that film. Also may I just add before I finish this review that Christopher Plummer was very handsome in this film.Thumbs up for The Sound Of Music.'The hills are alive,with the sound of music'.10/10 A+Lady Gaga also did a melody of this at the Oscars this year to celebrate the movie for being 50 years old(yes ladies and gentlemen this movie marked 50 years this year as the film came out in March 1965).\n",

      "Review Text: I come here to review \"The Sound of Music\", not to praise it. Yes, like the billions of other fans, I have seen this so many times I pretty much know it by heart. Like \"The Wizard of Oz\", I have seen it both on television and the big screen, and have decided that for at least the next 10 years, I am leaving it alone. Still, one cannot forget about it, no matter how hard one tries. With sing-along showings of it at the Hollywood Bowl, constant dredging up at piano bars and the many spoofs it has received, \"The Sound of Music\" has not died in my heart, just become momentarily dormant.I actually prefer the stage version (a 1995 revival) to the movie, as it was not overloaded with helicopter covered shots of the Alps or constant liederhosen clad kids, and basically stuck to the flour of the story rather than the frosting. Yet, there is something unshakable of Julie Andrews in her second big \"Nanny\" film as Maria Rainer Von Trapp, the former postulate who ends up marrying her employer and helps him escape from the Nazis.In the first dozen times I saw this, I of course was overwhelmed by the helicopter shot of the Alps that eventually closes in on Julie twirling around the mountainside. What I did miss was the opening verse of the title song, sung so simply by Mary Martin in the 1959 original and Rebecca Luker decades later. The opening is equivalent to that of director Robert Wise's other big movie musical, \"West Side Story\", even if the locations and mood are as far from each other as they can get. When the nuns sing of their issues with Maria (which includes a future \"General Hospital\" legend, Anna Lee, as well as movie musical dubber Marni Nixon), I am in delight, because like those nuns, I too am conflicted by her. So how will she deal with the seven bratty children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his whistle blowing and his baroness fiancée (a cynical Eleanor Parker)?This sweet set-up, though, has serious overtones as World War II is blooming as much as the edelweiss, and after Maria and the Captain fall in love, the world changes from teaching the kids the notes to sing to finding a way to get out a country that while beautiful on the outside is in danger of becoming ugly on the inside. This changes the second half of the film (as it did the play) from a learning experience for all of these characters to a survival lesson where they must struggle to \"Climb Every Mountain\".Somewhat overproduced and certainly extremely long, it is still a crowd- pleaser that I can't recommend highly enough. Yes, my rating is not a \"10\", but that's from possibly too many viewings, sometimes too soon. Everybody shines in the film, although in a few particular moments, Plummer's phrasing and delivery of his dialog seems a bit awkward. It's nice to see Richard Haydn playing a character not as annoying as those he did in \"The Late George Apley\" and \"Sitting Pretty\"; He's obviously an opportunist and not afraid to admit it, yet in a few spots, shows definite heroism. Parker gets some great bitchy lines to deliver and adds some needed salt into the sugary proceedings.The heart and soul of the film, though, is Peggy Wood's Mother Superior, the equivalent in Rodgers and Hammerstein's cavalcade to \"Oklahoma's\" Aunt Eller, \"Carousel's\" Nettie, \"South Pacific's\" Bloody Mary and \"The King and I's\" Madame Thiang. She's not without some imperfections, and when she barrels out her line, \"Are you in love with him?\", it seems as if she's looking for a good piece of gossip. But when Anna Lee and Portia Nelson (later \"All My Children's\" long-time baby sitter Mrs. Gurney) admit they have sinned, her reaction is priceless and a proper send-off. \"Family Guy\" crudely spoofed this scene years later.As for Julie Andrews, how can you not like her? She didn't get to repeat her Broadway roles at all, but fortunately 20th Century Fox got her for this, and I must say, her Maria is certainly more appealing as a Nanny than her Mary Poppins. It's obvious that she loves these children, is humble and far from the other worldly creature of the role for which she had just won an Oscar.\n",

Andrews and Plummer are quite good in the leads and the children are all adorable (awww!). The cinematography beautifully captures the Austrian countryside. It is all masterfully guided by Wise, an under-rated director who also made the other great musical of the 1960s, \"West Side Story.\" Despite its great length, it manages to stay engaging, thanks to a fine script. Most of all, there is the wonderful music of Rodgers and Hammerstein, including \"My Favorite Things,\" \"Do Re Mi,\" and the title tune, starting with that memorable aerial shot.\n",

      "Review Text: Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film – it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike.The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria – she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps – firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace.From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades",
      " but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent – Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors – so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films – are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.\n",

      "Review Text: The beautiful music is at the heart of The Sound Of Music. Richard Rodgers' gorgeous and varied melodies, and Oscar Hammerstein's exquisite and witty lyrics don't just dazzle you - they move the story along. Even Eidelweiss, such a simple ballad, is a gem. The Sound Of Music is a wonderful (kind of) true story: a nun, Maria, wins the hearts of a sad, strict widower and his seven children who she is sent to mind as governess. It's a classic look back at the sadness of exile and oppression, the triumph of goodness over evil and the joy that just one woman, Maria, makes in people's lives. As Maria, Julie Andrews has great chemistry with Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). The child actors are great. The choreography and the script are both a bit regimented - probably because this was a polished stage show before the movie. Overall, this is one of the classic movie musicals, possibly the best ever.\n",

      "Review Text: The story of \"The Sound of Music\" is a simple one; a postulant in an Austrian nunnery in the 1930s becomes the governess to the children of a widowed aristocratic naval captain and ends up falling in love with him. The two marry, but are forced to flee Austria when the Nazis invade in 1938. It is, very loosely, based on the story of the real Von Trapp family, although it takes many liberties with historical fact. In reality, Georg and Maria von Trapp fell in love in the twenties, not the thirties, were married in 1927 and had two children of their own by 1938. Maria was actually heavily pregnant at the time of her wedding, something tactfully omitted from the film. The family actually left Austria for America before, not after, the Anschluss. The film also differs somewhat, both in its plot line and its music, from the original Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical; when I first saw it in the theatre I was surprised to hear unfamiliar songs which do not feature in the film. One song, \"Something Good\", which was specially written for the film is now normally sung in stage productions, even though it was not included in the original.This was the Big Film of 1965 and the winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture. It was a great box-office success, and is sometimes credited with saving 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy after their huge losses on \"Cleopatra\". Nevertheless, it has a rather curious reputation today. It has not (unlike some films which were regarded as Big Films in their day) sunk into obscurity, but neither is it universally regarded as a beloved classic. There are of course some, especially among the older generation, who do think of it in that way, but for many it has taken on the status of a slightly naff guilty pleasure, something enjoyable if taken with a large pinch of irony. There is one cinema in London which hosts regular \"Sound of Music\" singalongs, with the audience encouraged to join in the songs and to dress up as nuns or Nazis. (I understand that on these occasions it is usual for the men to dress as Nazis and the women as nuns, although the opposite arrangement is by no means unknown).Certainly, this was a film I hated in my youth. I was first taken to see it as a child- it was the first film I ever saw in the cinema apart from a few Disney cartoons- and I didn't really understand what was going on. In my teenage years in the seventies and eighties it seemed to be on television ever Christmas, Easter and Bank Holiday, and I seemed to have to sit though every screening. (It was one of my mother's favourite films). In common with a lot of contemporaries I came to think of it as corny, sentimental and terminally uncool- a view shared by quite a few critics. Pauline Kael was allegedly dismissed from her job with McCall's magazine after writing a scathing review of it, and even its director Robert Wise originally described the story as \"too saccharine\". (He changed his mind after the director originally hired, William Wyler, dropped out). When in the mid-nineties the BBC included it in a season of \"The 100 Greatest Films of All Time\" one critic sneered that it did not even count as one of The 100 Greatest Musicals Set in Austria.Despite (or perhaps because of) that sneer I decided to watch that screening, and realised that the film was much better than I had previously given it credit for, an impression strengthened when I recently saw it again for the first time in about fifteen years. Of course, it does have its faults. Some of the songs- \"My Favourite Things\" in particular- really are too sentimental for words, and the film's schematic morality is a bit too black-and-white to be artistically satisfying. In the white corner you have nuns, cute children, true love and the power of music. In the black corner you have the Nazis. Not much room for a grey area there.Yet the film also has its virtues. The photography, of the magnificent Alpine scenery and of the architecture of Salzburg, is particularly fine. Richard Rodgers wrote some of his best music for the original stage-show, including songs like \"Edelweiss\", \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\", and the title song, and the performers, especially Julie Andrews, do it full justice here. Andrews makes a likable heroine, combining musical ability with tenderness, practicality and religious faith. Christopher Plummer's Captain, however, is perhaps a bit too strict and authoritarian in the early scenes for his later transition into romantic hero to be altogether convincing, and he is too young for the part, appearing not only to have become a father while still in his teens but also to have served in the Austrian navy as a ten-year-old. I wouldn't rate the film quite as highly as Wise's other famous musical, \"West Side Story\", but then that is in my opinion, one of the greatest musicals ever. Despite the disdain in which it is held in some quarters, and the rather patronising post-modern irony with which it is regarded in others, \"The Sound of Music\" is a well-crafted, if now rather old-fashioned, piece of family entertainment. 8/10\n",

There are many things going on in the house. The oldest daughter is dating a Nazi. The father (Played by Christopher Plummer) is engaged to a bitch. Maria soon falls in love with the father, and the father soon falls for her.This three hour long musical is fantastic. It deserved best picture in my opinion.

The cast of this joyous musical was letter-perfect, and the film is timeless. I last saw this on a big screen a few years ago at one of the Grant Park \"Movies In The Park\", where an appreciative audience sang along with the songs (although this was NOT the sing-along version) and applauded at the conclusion of various songs and scenes. It always astonishes me when I hear that some critics dislike this film.

Julie Andrews is back as another nanny (or, governess) to rambunctious children (this time 7), but her magical powers are confined to a guitar and a lilting soprano. The romance between she and Christopher Plummer doesn't work because his haughty decadence seems more in tune with Eleanor Parker's ice-poison beauty than with Andrews' overeager tomboy. Cast as Maria, a novice hired away from the convent, Julie isn't always the jovial Mary Poppins here; she's rather stern and overly precise, and when she returns as Plummer's wife, there's an awkward chasm between she and the family, as if they're asking, \"Who is this new person?\" The songs are fine, and the kids aren't offensive, but I can see why some refer to this as \"The Sound of Mucus\".

      "Review Text: A movie made in a time when directors like Robert Wise who knew how to craft a musical were still around. Suffers terribly when viewed on a small screen since the brilliant cinematography is such an integral factor of the movie. Get the newer THX widescreen video version and you will see a glimpse of what the film would be like on a big screen. The movie still holds up well to nineties standards but may be a little sugary for hardened modern moviegoers, used to a diet of violence and profanity. Wise manages to make Julie Andrews look both virginal and alluring at the same time, which is essential for the plot to work. It is hard to imagine the movie with any other actress than Andrews playing Maria's part. Some may criticize Roger and Hammerstein as not being in the same league as other noted movie composers, but here the combination of composers/director/actors all comes together in a way seldom matched.\n",

      "Review Text: A microcosm of the idealistic and affluent Austria is The Von Tropp children, who are trapped in their mansion by their Navy Captain father, not quite got over the death of his wife. When along comes \"innocent nun wash out\" Julie Andrews as another nanny (again), well you know she's not going to simply take care of children despite their attempts to rattle her. 174 minute running time and silly set up out of the way, I must admit that the music and sentiment are absolutely timeless as is the anti-Nazi theme patriotically defended on screen by Christopher Plummer, who tosses his selfish Austrian babe. Clearly he saw something in Maria that was lost on the rest of us, but never the less after singing, dancing and performing incredibly intricate marionette routines, I guess we owe the Von Tropps and their singing instructor a free pass over the mountain.\n",

      "Review Text: Most people are afraid to admit it but \"The Sound of Music\" remains one of the best and most classic musical movies ever made. I would also say that this is an almost perfect example of the genre but let me put some more emphasis on the word almost.Honestly, you could you not like this movie? It's cheerful, colorful and very charming. It's set in great colorful environments, features a sort of simple, no-worries type of story (untill its final 30 minutes) and some great and very memorable songs. It's a movie that can really lift your mood while watching it.To me this actually seems like a movie that can best be seen on the large silver screen. The nature environments, the sets, the colors, the camera-work, it all deserves to be seen on a large screen and it will make the movie no doubt look even better than it already does on an average sized television. There are still plenty of screening every year, so if you get the opportunity I really would recommend you to see this movie on the silver screen.Yes, it's a long sit, since the movie is almost 3 hours long but the movie is definitely worth it. It still is a bit odd to me though, that no matter how long the movie is, its ending still feels very rushed. Seriously, the whole WW II aspects got hardly mentioned at all in the first 2 hours of the movie and then boom! Suddenly there is a war going on. There is no real good build-up to it in its story, which in my opinion seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. The final 30 minutes feel really crammed in and rushed. Besides, in my opinion the movie never really reaches a fully satisfying conclusion. It still leaves a lot of questions open and has some loose ends in it, as if they were perhaps expecting to make a sequel to this movie some day.But this is not the only problem I had with the second half of the movie. I was really liking the movie for its cheerful atmosphere and uplifting story and characters but I did not at all see it's love story coming up. To me there was absolutely nothing at all that indicated that Maria and Captain Von Trapp were falling for each other and that these two persons were meant to be together. I was actually quite happy about it that for a change this looked to be a musical in which the two main characters wouldn't fall in love with each other. It pretty much came out of nowhere for me and it just didn't seemed to be something that this movie and its story needed.No complaints about the acting obviously. It still is Julie Andrews' most iconic and memorable role and Christopher Plummer also did a pretty good job. You probably wouldn't had recognized him, since he's still so very young and different looking in this movie. Can't also really complain about the child cast, though I should say that's its just a bit odd that none of the children really look alike. The one has blond hair and blue eyes, while the other dark hair with brown eyes. None of them really look they could be brothers or sisters in real life. But of course I understand that it would had been quite hard to find 7, singing, dancing and acting children, that also all look alike as well.With this movie Robert Wise once more showed his amazing versatility and talent as a director. Seriously, is there any genre this guy hasn't worked in? He of course had some practice already, with his other much acclaimed musical \"West Side Story\". But even when looking at just these two movies you'll notice how much different they actually are in its style and approach. Again, also this really shows how incredibly versatility and talented as a director Robert Wise was.All in all this remains a nearly perfect musical movie, that despite all my criticism of it, really remains a great and truly enjoyable watch.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music is a favorite childhood movie, teenage movie, young adult movie, and adult movie. It was basically my reference for love throughout my life. It's how I made sure I was in love at 23 and then thereafter, was the beginning of a huge database of potential love songs that I made up for me and my new-found love ever after life. I learnt at the young age of 9 that love could be that exciting, I even learnt all the metaphors and became from there a young lady in waiting I should say except that I would have to consider it a shoulder but I can't. I feel that this movie is a good reference. One with all the details you would need t move on with life and love, one that you could reference later in case you were confused and then you can start all over again.\n",

      "Review Text: Honestly, what more can I say about it? I don't know what made this musical such a hit, but I love it!It's about a nun, Maria (and I'm guessing they got the realities wrong) who goes to babysit seven children for Captain Von Trapp, and the rest goes from there.I'm guessing that what most people find the most memorable about the entire movie are the songs, which are great! I'll go into the ones most people get invested into (sorry if I miss any). For Sound of Music (song) I think that not only was it Julie Andrew's singing that made the song feel welcoming, but the melody and the environment she was in and the fact that it was the opening number rather than the second song of the musical (I think that's what the original play did). It made me feel excited, calm, and ready for her adventure. Sixteen Going on Seventeen thrills me to death! It's a boyfriend and girlfriend hanging out (though it probably didn't really happen), and he's telling her the dangers of being naive, while at the same time adoring her! My Favorite Things, try singing it during a thunder storm! That's what happens in this song and it's so charming. Do I need to say what it is about Do-Re-Mi that makes singing contagious? Even though it is singing notes over and over, any time one person starts singing that song it makes lots of people want to join in! It doesn't make sense, but I think that it was once again Julie Andrews' singing, playing guitar, and in the multiple environments that she and the children were hanging out in that made that song a hit.I may not know why I love it, but aside from getting the life of Maria Von Trapp inaccurate it makes a great story - musical standing on it's own merits.\n",

In reaction scenes at the party, she appears convincingly distracted, since she saw her fiancee, The Captain (Christopher Plummer) dancing warmly with the nanny Maria (Julie Andrews). The sultry character is commonly labelled the villainess, but she traveled all the way from Vienna to marry her beau, only to be pushed aside by a (younger) charmer; of course the Captain was a willing participant, too. Acting, script, direction, score, photography still exemplary.\n",

It actually had some genuine tension when the NAZI's where using their influence. But first and foremost it is a love story between two people from different classes. Mary Poppins, sorry, Julie Andrews, as Maria, leaves the parish as she was on track to become a nun and begins to work for a widowed naval captain as the governess to watch over his seven children. He is extremely strict and regimented and she is more free-spirited and takes a different approach in his job. Slowly, she is able to melt away the captain's steely demeanor. This is a pleasant romance tale with some catchy numbers that progress the story. Certainly a good family viewing.\n",

      "Review Text: Some critics have labelled it corn, but if it is, you'll never find a better variety. What more can you want? A beautiful cast, pleasant music, and fabulous scenery in the Austrian alps. Oh, sure, the camera is mostly very static, not much better than the Italian 1913 version of THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII. Perhaps the Todd AO process camera was unwieldy,or perhaps the director just liked it that way. As for Julie Andrews, what other actress can all at the same time project vulnerability, strength, and emotional fire? There cannot be too many such. Eleanor Parker has a thankless role as a possible wife for the von Trapp paterfamilias, but we know from the start that she hasn't a prayer up against Maria, the postulant sent out from a nearby convent as governess for the von Trapp family seven kids. Just the same, Eleanor displays her usual talent and is an ornament to the film. At the end, as the family flees the Nazi anschluss into Austria, we finally get some action and a little camera movement, with tracking shots. Whatever cavils one may rake up, this is Julie Andrews' film, no question.\n",

The panoramic views of mountains and hills are done on purpose for the author to set a scene. The blues lead to feelings of tranquility and peace, whilst the greens give an enriching feeling of life. The opening scenes create such beauty, and the styles of houses that are shown clearly dictate the wealth of the area. This is quite a contrast to the modest girl, singing with such an angelic voice, whose clothing does not show wealth, but modesty and simplicity. She is on her own in these beautiful hills, leading the viewers to believe she may want to escape and that she may be a solitary person...this movie is an absolute must to watch, rich with history, emotion and social privilege.\n",

My parents were watching it in the living room late at night and I hid behind a curtain to watch the movie because it was past my bedtime. And when it finished, I just fell in love. With everything. Just, I adored it. I got nearly every single of those beautifully crafted songs stuck in my head, and by the morning I was singing \"Sixteen going on Seventeen\" all the way to school.It's the kinda classic that you have to appreciate, not just for its ingenuity, but it's ability to stay light hearted, joyous, and lively. Everything from the acting, the costumes, the settings, the plot, the MUSIC just cement it as thr greatest musical ever. No not just musical, but movie in general. It's one of those movies I have to rewatch it at least 3 or more times a year because I cannot recover from the pure feeling a joy it gives me. And for a movie that originated from the 60's, the quality is amazing! It never lacked substance.I'm purely glad that this movie won Best Picture of it's year. I watch this with my family at least once a year. We all love it. It was because of this movie I got interested in Musical theater, and I still am to this day.Always a special place in my heart.\n",

      "Review Text: When I was a kid, maybe ten or eleven years old, I was tapped to be a stagehand in an amateur teen production of \"The Sound of Music\". This would have been a few years before the movie came out. It was a cool gig, getting to hang out with and watch the older kids. My main job was to help raise and lower the stage curtain, too much for somebody my size so I was teamed up with someone else. There was even a bit part for me in the play in some dance scene where I had to actually touch some yucky girl. I'm glad I outgrew that foolish tendency.That was when I was first introduced to the music of Rodgers and Hammerstein, and it didn't take long to learn the words to now popular standards like Do Re Mi, Favorite Things and Edelweiss, not to mention the title song. Curiously, I was never moved to watch the film version of \"The Sound of Music\" until recently. My loss, as this is a wonderful family film for all ages, even if part of it it deals with the largely unspoken terror of Nazi occupation in Austria. That theme is jarringly brought home with the first utterance of 'Heil Hitler' by the bureaucratic Herr Zeller, and sets the backdrop for the film's finale as the Von Trapp family flees their homeland.For all of that, the film serves quite well as an entertaining musical, with elements of comedy mixed in as student nun Maria (Julie Andrews) becomes governess for a widower naval captain (Christopher Plummer) with seven children. By dint of common sense and humility, Maria gains the respect and love of the entire family, eventually falling in love herself, with a man she probably would not have sought out under normal circumstances. In a touching scene, the Reverend Mother helps Maria sort out her conflicted feelings and return to the Von Trapp household. For my part, I thought the Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) was way too gracious in her understanding of the Captain's true feelings, and in her case, discretion was truly the better part of valor.Fans of movie musicals will certainly find \"The Sound of Music\" at or near the top of their favorite films list. Filling it's nearly three hour run time are a host of wonderful songs, many to my surprise which were done more than once. I predict you'll come away from the picture singing or humming your own particular favorite, as the film has a way of working that kind of magic as it tells it's timeless story.\n",

From the first second, which has a magnificent entrance to the film, it is a film that has passed into the history of cinema, filled with joy, sometimes sadness, but usually happiness. Andrews, who won acclaim with Mary Poppins, forms a harmonious duo with Plummer, while each of the von Trapp children, who are at the center of the film, are very cute. We see that the magnificent beauty of Salzburg is also crowned as a different character throughout the film. Quality songs that have been expressed musically also attract attention. It never bores a person to listen to it many times. Predictable entry-development-results do not bother at all. In fact, the film shifts to a lot of politics in the last quarter. Let's also remind that it is inspired by real events and characters that have happened. So the von Trapp family is completely real. After watching the movie, those who are curious can do some research. It can be recommended unconditionally to everyone young and old, one of the rare films that can win everyone's liking.\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music opens with stunning aerial shots of the Austrian natural landscape. The camera then sweeps down and moves forward toward a speck that grows larger and larger to reveal",
      "Maria (Julie Andrews), the lead character, running with unbridled joy on a grassy hilltop, and breaking into the title song with such gracefulness and confidence that it is impossible not to fall in love with her at once. This famous opening sequence sets the tone for the entire film, one of hopeful optimism, as director Robert Wise creates a near-perfect motion picture adaptation of the Broadway musical, together with original songs by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II.Written by Ernest Lehman (West Side Story, 1961; Hello, Dolly!, 1969), who adapts the material from Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse's book of the same name, The Sound of Music tells the inspiring story of Maria, an assertive nun-to-be who is forced to leave her convent temporarily to become a governess to the seven children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a Naval officer and widower whose strict authoritarian rule has caused his children to lose their freedom and childhood. Maria's arrival brings change to the lives of the children, and slowly thaws Von Trapp's cold and cynical heart, mending his heartbreak of the last few years, and giving him a newfound purpose in life.Winning five Oscars including one for Best Picture, The Sound of Music is set during the pre-Hitler years in Austria, and features some of the world's best loved songs such as \"Do Re Mi\", \"My Favorite Things\", and \"Edelweiss\". In fact, one of the most unforgettable moments in the film shows Plummer strumming on the guitar and singing \"Edelweiss\" to his eager children. Many of the songs are catchy and fun to sing along. More crucially, they are well-linked to the narrative, and with every repetition, they add a new layer of meaning to the emotions the characters face in the different stages of the film.Andrews' energetic performance is the heartbeat of this film. Without her, The Sound of Music would not have been half as successful. She acts and sings as if she was born for the role of Maria. Despite the long runtime, Wise's picture is never at any point lackluster. Andrews' likable screen persona and strong screen presence bring forth a high degree of engagement with the viewer. It is difficult to take your eyes off her whenever she appears on screen, and this is especially so when she is together with Plummer, who shares with her an intentionally awkward chemistry that provides the film with most of its humor and drama.One may drown in the wonderful music and songs, but at its thematic core, The Sound of Music is a film that teaches us to stay true to ourselves, to know our identity, and to share the meaning of joy and living with others. If there ever was a great motion picture that everyone in the family could enjoy, you are looking at it. Perhaps the most memorable of dramatic musicals, The Sound of Music promises an entertaining, satisfying, and heartwarming three hours of cinematic goodness that year after year still remains thoroughly rewatchable.GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.\n",

      "Review Text: \"The Sound of Music\" tells the story of Maria, a warm and lively nun, who serves as a tutor to seven children in the home of retired Austrian naval captain Trapp. The captain's wife died a few years ago, and the captain became disheartened and disciplined his children in the same way he disciplined his sailors. Children's lives are as routine and lifeless as a pendulum. Maria came to the colonel's house, to adapt to the children's natural lively characteristics, teach them to sing and dance, take them to picnic, outing, climbing trees and boating, make the home full of joy. Her passion and love won the children's trust and affection, and eventually won the colonel's love, and later became the children's mother.The memorable music I heard in The movie was that Maria use her skill create a song that sounds like Do a dear a female dear...... It's also the most favourite song for me in the whole movie. Even though in a rainy day, Maria also create a fantastic song, I still think that the music at the beginning of the movie is the best.I really love that movie.\n",

      "Review Text: \"What kind of fruitcake likes this insanely unrealistic story?\" So wail those who hate Sound of Music: Austria as Ruritania, Julie Andrews as cheerfully smiling, singing and dancing novice/governess and so mercilessly sanitized children that they make mockery of every real brat that has ever lived. And there lies the irony. Loosely inspired by the true story of Trapp Family Singers, this musical about singing Austrian family escaping Nazis is indeed insanely unrealistic. It is richly Technicolored, fancifully romantic, clean and entertaining, made with old-fashioned class and craftsmanship... old-fashioned, yes, and in the good way.\n",

      "Review Text: One Of The Best Movie I've Ever Seen This film is timeless, beautiful, inspiring, and uplifting, but I would advise that anyone who watches this would be mature enough, for anyone under the age of 15 will brush this movie aside, saying it is lame so as to maintain their level of coolness. I saw this happen when I asked my little sisters to watch it with me. They rolled their eyes and said the movie was terrible and boring. If only they understood. You have to have an open mind, and forget everything every little kid has said negative about this film. I never wanted to watch this, but some fellow high school seniors RECOMMENDED it to me. Obviously they had open minds, and they didn't care if they looked cool or not. Please watch this movie. It will make you happy, and it is so beautiful, you will almost cry. I had never really liked musicals, and perhaps I still do not overly enjoy them, but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven, which is where it should belong, not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours.\n",

      "Review Text: This movie will always be a favorite of mine for the holidays, even though I know the facts where drastically changed from that of the real Von Trap family and their story. But even with that it is a very well done and charming story. I don't usually like musicals but this one has had my attention since I was a child and has become an annual event in my family, even if I have to watch it alone I have it on every year. I even put up with the teasing I get from my friends over liking it.Back in the 90's a saw an interview with the real Maria Von Trap and she was talking about how different the movie was from her book. I never believe Hollywood when they say based on a true story that usually means they kept some of the names and none of the facts, so I decided to get her book and get the facts behind the Hollywood facts of the movie. I found the book very well written and of course very different from the movie but it never dimmed my enjoyment of the movie. I just look at the movie as a nice piece of fiction and enjoy it separately for the real story.Besides, we all know there hasn't been an original thought in Hollywood in decades.\n",

I love having lots of children in the film as well and having them singing, because most big hit films only include adults, or adults and a couple of children. It's nice for that element. Little Gretl and Marta are so sweet to watch, and one day I dream of being Liesl and performing her role. The film has been an inspiration for me since I was a very little girl, and i hope to fulfill my ambitions of starring in a staged production of 'The Sound Of Music'. I love the film and I will always love it! The dancing, acting and singing inspires me!\n",

      "Review Text: This movie is about a family (Von Trapp) living in Salzburg, Austria just before WW2. Maria wants to be a nun, but this is clearly not the type of life that she's meant to live. Captain Von Trapp is a widower with 7 children and is having difficulty finding a governess who wants to stay (the kids run everyone else off). At first, the kids try to make Maria leave by playing pranks on her, but they quickly find that she's different and like being with her as she finds fun things for them to do (something their father has not done), and the Captain also considers her special. To everyone's surprise, Maria disappears during a party. I won't say anything else about the plot (that's for you to find out).The movie is great for the whole family if you like the older movies, especially musicals. You wouldn't find a new movie like this classic (entertainment has changed a lot, and many people living today were born after WW2 ended). The music and storyline make it more re-watchable than many movies I've seen, some of which I don't care to see more than once or twice (but I might become tired of this movie if I watched it every week or every month, as a few people say they do).\n",

There are many singable and recognizable songs in this movie, but there also are well-done characters brought to light by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer.  Sometimes the story gets faded by melo-dramatic romantic moments, but what the heck(it is a musical, you know). Cinematically beautifully captured mountains and Austrian landscape also lend to the appreciation of this play brought to film.  There definetly are not many movies like this that bring together drama and music so well.  I guess this and many other reasons are why this movie will be loved for a long time.\n",

      "Review Text: I must stress yet again the fact that I don't like musicals, therefore I have avoided for years films such as this Academy Award winning 'classic'. Finally though, I have subjected myself to it, and survived.Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II have written some real show stoppers including the title track, \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"My Favourite Things\", \"Climb Every Mountain\" and the traditional \"Edelweiss\". All these catchy memorable tunes cannot dress up this predictable romance about an inept nun whose penchant appears to be with kids rather than for service to God in an abbey. Overlong and self-indulgent, it may have been the order of the day in the mid-60's, but not today. Only entertainment lies in Miss Andrew's splendid voice and the fun loving music.Political overtones may also be out of place, and if you want to get picky, though the cast do well, nobody portrays an Austrian very convincingly. Screenwriter Ernest Lehmann, along with director Robert Wise, has been very true to the stage musical, which undoubtedly pleased its legions of fans.Boris Leven's production design is grand, cinematography (Ted McCord and Paul Beeson) in the Austrian mountains is completely breathtaking, but the costumes are ridiculous.Saturday, October 7, 1995 - Video\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music is a legendary while heartwarming movie about story of a governess(nun), Maria, living in Captain von Trapp's house with seven children. This movie is based on a Broadway musical also called The Sound of Music of 1959. Because of the success and fame from the memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria Augusta von Trapp and the Tony awarded musical by Richard Rodgers, director Robert Wise and his team started the staging and filming of the movie version of The Sound of Music in 1960. The movie starred actors like Julie Andrews, who plays Maria, Christopher Plummer, who plays Captain, Richard Haydn, Eleanor Parker and so many more. The film released on the second of March in 1965 in the U.S. Because of the fantastic production and music, the movie became the highest grossing film of 1965 and one of the highest grossing film of all time. As of today, the film has grossed almost 1.3 billion dollars. \n",
      " The Sound of Music is considered one of the best family movie of the 1900s. It is remembered by many people from different decades, countries and ages. The story starts with Maria, casted by Julie, signing on the hill about how she really likes the nature and life in the countryside of Austria. This scene is one of the prettiest scene in the movie. With the calm and relaxing background, it captures the energy of the actors and the film itself from the beginning. Maria is called to take care of Captain von Trapp's seven children. Captain, casted by Christopher, tells Maria all about the rules that she has to comply living with his children, such as marching around the house and going to bed on time(almost like military practices). This part of the movie captures the rigid routine and education of the 1940s. This also briefly brings out the setting of World War II. When the Captain is away to Vienna, Maria starts secretly taking the children to play and to sing. During this part of the movie, songs like \"Do-Re-Mi\" has born and ingrained on decades of people. Apart from just being relevant to the Broadway and Hollywood's community, schools has begun teaching children the songs from the movie for so many years too. In a party, Maria finds out that they might be in love with each other. Therefore, she flees back to abbey without telling the von Trapp family. The chemistry between Maria and Captain is very magical in the movie. The way Julie acts as a shy but adventurous girl in that love relationship could win her any awards for a leading actress. After a while of confessing their loves, Maria and Captain get married. Unfortunately, in the same time, Nazi Germany has taken over Austria and Captain is forced to serve in the navy under the Nazi. This part of the movie is very much tied to the history. It also conveys a conflict to the story which leads to a lovely singing scene by the von Trapp family. Because Captain is loyal to his country Austria, he plans on fleeing away. From playing in the Austrian show as the of the \"von Trapp Family Singers,\" they somehow find an escape. The story ends with the family climbing the mountain to escape the country. Even though it is not a particularly happy ending, the family is still able to stay together in the end. To me, this is the best way to end the movie because it ends with an open ending which gives audience an opportunity to think about both the ending and the movie in general.\n",
      " The Sound of Music is a multi-nominated and awarded movie. They received several Academy Award while winning five of them: including the Best Picture and the Best Director. The story plot is wonderful because it is a lovely family story. The actors in the movie are really phenomenal too. Most of the actors are little kids but they show the talents and potentials of being good actors. Not only they have to sing, they also have to act in the same time. My favorite part of the movie is when the children sing the song \"Farewell\" in the party because they show both the fun and professional part of being actors. I also really admire how the youngest actress shows the shyness but also the stubborn part of her character throughout the movie. The leading, Golden Globe awarded actress Julie Andrews is fantastic in the movie from the start to the end. She shows the openness and happiness of Maria with her acting flawlessly. Besides, with the support of tunes like \"Do-Re-Mi,\" \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen,\" and \"My Favorite Things,\" the movie soundtrack also was ranked as number one album of the year in Billboard 200. The Sound of Music is also listed as the fifty-fifth greatest American movie according to American Film Institute. I would highly recommend this movie because of the production, artistry and chemistry among the actors. As the Library of Congress had once commented, \"The Sound of Music is culturally, historically and aesthetically significant;\" it is a movie that everyone must watch no matter what their ages are.\n",

Another reason I like it is Julie Andrews' amazing performance as Maria, a girl who longs for a better life, I think. Maria is beautiful, has a beautiful voice, mixed with nervousness and sadness, all qualities that Andrews brings to her performances. The only film she slightly disappointed was Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as is the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. I can't pick a favorite scene, but who can forget the opening and the \"Do ah Dear\" sequence? I also thought the kids were sweet and the movie had some clever subplots, like Liesels secret love. 10/10 for a musical, which should be in the top 250. It's number 2 on Greatest Musicals, beating out Grease.\n",

      "Review Text: I am someone in my late teens, and yet some may wonder why I like this movie which came out in the 60s. Interstingly enough, it was actually during my past History classes where my History teacher mentioned about this movie. The Nazi era under Hitler was part of the syllabus in my History textbook then and it touched a little in the movie itself.Enough of history over there. So, actually this movie was shown here last year like days before the musical version of it arrives here. Given my family has the tickets to go watch the musical (we were being invited to go watch), it was me who was actually more excited than anyone else in the family when the movie came out here on the local television to maybe somehow coincide with the musical production.Based on the events of Maria and the Von Trapp family (they do exist in history), the viewers are taken to beautiful sights in Austria. Now that is only a part of the movie plot. Maria (Julie Andrews) was actually a nun in a convent when one day she was being sent to be a governess to a family of seven children. When she was there, she began to bring to joy and music in the house, which was what the head of the house Captain Von Trapp once told Maria about the latter. Music was what was missing in the house. Ever since the passing of his wife, he had turned his house almost like a military of sorts.Each of the seven children has their own characteristics. It's especially interesting to see the eldest child and daughter being the one who told outright that she does not need a governess given she is 17 or something (thus the song 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen' and also one of my favourites) but yet in the end, she accepted Maria.But, the joy in the house was soon marred by the incoming occupation by the Nazis from Hitler. Anschluss, as it's being termed in German as meaning the union between two countries (considering what I had learnt in History is almost becoming rusty, oops). Captain Von Trapp was never a Nazi supporter and he make it indirectly clear. Also at this time, he has actually met a baroness and wanted to marry her. His seven children had never like the baroness one bit. They rather prefer Maria over her. Soon the Captain understood his children's intentions and he marries Maria.Still, given the political situation in Austria is getting a little sticky with the intending Nazi occupation, the Von Trapp family plotted a way to escape after a singing competition. And they managed it successfully.I know indirectly I am telling the whole plot outline...but I cannot help it. This is one movie musical which is just a pure winner not only in terms of the songs, other than the plot outline which is based on real events. Everyone in the family will be able to enjoy, regardless of age! Definitely a classic movie.\n",

      "Review Text: This is one of my all time favorite films. It is a classic. Even after all these years when I watch this film I think it is well done. The music is of course the biggest plus of this great film. Filmed on location, they do a great job of bringing you into the story. Julie Andrews gives in my opinion her best performance out of any movie I have seen her in. You can feel the love that that the main characters have for each other. I would highly recommend taking the time to watch this film if you have not seen it before. I also found out that this story is based on a real life story. it is a bit sad to see how people were treated by the Germans. I think it would be hard to leave everything you have, but they did it.\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music is my most favourite movie ever! I know all the songs and all the dialogue. I watch it at least once a week. I told a guy at my school to watch it (well I kind of forced him to!) and now he can play the backing music of all the songs on the piano! I always make him play them so I can sing along with them! Recently I was on a choir trip and the night we won, we were in the dining room and I started singing Sixteen Going on Seventeen and I got everyone to join in! We ended up singing the entire score, it was so fun! I got so into it I ended up standing on the table and there are some really embarrassing photos of me, but it was worth if because everyone had a great time. My friend bought me a Sound of Music bag for my birthday, it had a really cool picture on it and it is my FAVOURITE bag!!! I would recommend the movie to anyone because it is FANTASTIC!!!!!\n",

      "Review Text: I first saw The Sound Of Music when I was 9 nine years old, have the album and know all the songs really well and it's still a fantastic musical that's beautifully made and loved across the world. Yet would it be such a good film if there wasn't so much artistic licence over the Von Trapp story.Firstly Georg Von Trapp didn't live in a mansion with servants and an enormous fortune, but for all he came from a wealthy aristocratic family was short of money and lived in a run down villa in a suburb of Salzburg. Secondly, while this to me is the most exciting part of the film, the family didn't hide from the Nazis in an abbey and then escape at night to Switzerland and then to America. The truth is rather more boring, while Georg Von Trapp was approached by the Nazis to take a commission in their Navy, there was no compulsion and the family left Austria of their own accord, although it is likely his dislike of Hitler could have caused him big trouble.However, this would have made for a rather boring film and the changes to the Von Trapp story make The Sound of Music so much more entertaining.\n",

      "Review Text: Firstly, the opening shot is magnificent: aerially gliding over snow-capped mountains, through valleys and streams, and finally setting on an extended forward rush toward Julie Andrews twirling about the hills. It strikes a triumphant opening chord as a marriage of form to content, as we are being granted witness to a person's burgeoning awareness of the world around her. How can she and the camera help but sing? Her first moments and interactions with the Von Trapp family seem staid by comparison, but Wise's typically astute craftsmanship and the contrasting approaches of Andrews and Plummer to their roles proves quite fascinating. And I must mention the subplot of encroaching Nazism, which yields some brilliantly executed suspense sequencesit doesn't get much more nerve-wracking than squatting behind a tombstone with the Von Trapp family as they're being tracked by the dogs and searchlights.\n",

      "Review Text: Sometimes there's a cultural institution about which you just don't see the big fuss, and for me, it's this film. I got dragged to it at least twice as an 8-year-old, didn't really like it then, and still don't get it. I don't think the lyrics come close to some of the Oscar Hammerstein classics, the score is not among Rodgers' best, to me at least, and having said all that, I think from what I've heard, the Broadway score is better. The film score is much heavier, less folksy. I particularly don't like the opening, the booming, over-orchestrated film version of the title song, compared to the understated stage version of the same song. I much prefer Julie Andrews overall in \"Mary Poppins,\" and vocally, by far, in \"My Fair Lady.\" If Christopher Plummer hated being in this movie, I think it shows. Having said all that, millions of people -- including my late mother, who rarely went to any movies, yet saw this at least three times, I think -- adore the film. So I guess I'm in the minority, but still, I have no desire to ever see this again.\n",

I realize that there is a lot of 'sugar' in this film, however, it remains to be one of my all time favorites. Unlike so many movies these days, this movie is filled with joy and happiness. My Mother took my 5 siblings and I too see this when it was re-released into theaters years after it came out in 1965(they used to do that with the bigger movies - before the days of VHS and DVDs). When we left the theater and walked home that evening, we talked about the movie the whoooole way, and sung the songs in it. It made such a wonderful & powerful impact on us, and to this day it is a family favorite.\n",

      "Review Text: I remember this film of course for the music but especially when you're a kid you overlook story-telling. Just like everyone else this music is some of the best ever put in a movie. It's funny how everyone seems to forget that just how absurd and unbelievable a lot of it is. For example the kids go from hating her to liking her in an extremely short time. Strangely enough, this movie is long & yes even some of the musical numbers drag it out longer than it needs to be. There is a lot of fun to be had especially for children & big fans of musicals. If you are willing to forget some of the weaker story-lines (I get it it's a G movie) but the Nazi's hardly play any significant or actually scary bad guys even compared to other G-Rated films. Still this as really good movie & I wish I would have just stuck to remembering how great it was when I saw it as a kid.\n",

      "Review Text: Part of the charm of one of my favorite movies are the little \"goofs\" most of which are listed already on IMDb. However, if Georg's youngest daughter is five and his wife died seven years ago, how does that work? Anyway, I first saw this movie with my aging mom in 1965, and as the theater was almost sold out we had to sit in the front row. Imagine my feelings as the camera zoomed in on the top of the hill and Maria started singing. I was spellbound. Not until Les Miserables have I had such an experience! In most movies there are both strong and weak characters. In Sound of Music I found every actor and actress believable. Julie Andrews as Maria was marvelous, but the best performance in my view was Christopher Plummer as the Captain. How he changed from the stiff formal unforgiving and aloof parent to a warm and caring father in a few brief scenes was great. I have seen the stage productions many times and no one else has pulled it off believably. Most stage musicals have failed in their transitions to film for example \" Annie\", but Sound of Music set the standard for future musicals to try and achieve.\n",

People will laugh at it, and perhaps mock it. Perhaps they are afraid or they simply do not understand it's greatness. But what you have to recognise is that the film IS a musical and so you have to expect the songs. They are after all well-written, and have good melodies. Also, i must mention the impeccable acting from both the children and Maria/Captain Von Trapp etc. Although the film is a little outdated in some aspects (the teenage boys on maria's bed for example), you cannot help but love this film.\n",

      "Review Text: This movie is indeed worthy to be called a classic. Yet it's in fact very much thanking the songs that are sung within it. The story feels flat and uninteresting for the first part, and predictable for the second part. Yet this is probably due to me watching this movie in 2015, fifty years after its original release, when everything had already developed, rendering the story within it to be quite obsolete. Thus when I imagine the conditions of the time when this movie was released, then this movie would've scored very high in terms of story background, development and flow. The thing is this movie has at least two of the most memorable songs in history; the very first song and the one about the musical notes (I didn't bother googling their titles). The acting overall feels flat for the standard of nowadays, but then again it must've been good at the time when it was released. Julie Andrews did quite well in maintaining her role's character. Christopher Plummer did also well in keeping the character's strictness.\n",

Christopher Plummer is beyond hateful and the whole shebang has these dreadful songs most of which Andrews sings as though presenting an elocution lesson. How it became the most watched and successful movie of its time is astonishing. Stories of numpties who have seen it 3,000,000 times at the cinema and love it more than life is really puzzling. I always wanted the Nazis to find them and incarcerate them somewhere dreadful and do terrible things to them because they were so sickeningly sweet. Julie Andrews hated the image that she became stuck with after TSOM and May Poppins but more fool her for even doing such dross.\n",

      "Review Text: The film opens with a long travelogue styled flight through the Alps, with little music and just the wind and the clear air for company, until we end up on that now famous hill top, where the sound of music soars high and loud. This was shot in one of the many rival formats of the day, in this case, TODD-AO, a dynamic 70mm frame, and projected onto a massive screen, to great effect.It is on that hilltop that we meet Maria, Julie Andrews, as she sings her way around the hills and Austria, unable to contain her musical aspiration or free spirit. We soon learn that she is finding it difficult to find her way as a nun, and is sent to work as a governess for Christopher Plummer's, Capatin von Trapp's, seven children.Once there, she manages to endear herself to the family and well, the rest is history. The film is based on a true story but there a are several differences, mainly surrounding the political situation to added effect and the names and ages of the children to name but a few.In the end the film looks great, with the von Trapp's villa set in a glorious location in Austria, relaxing a peaceful. There is a great sense of the family's interaction and growing bonds, both with the children and the Captain, whilst there is a gentle threat and tension from the baroness, the third party in the love triangle within the film, but there is little nastiness within the film, with the exception of the Nazi element, obviously.With memorable songs, beautiful surroundings and great direction from Robert Wise, this has more than earned its place within the annuls of Hollywood greatness and will no doubt continue to flourish for generations to come, as timeless is not the word.\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound Of Music is a classic of the musical genre and is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. The plot concerns a young Austrian woman called Maria (Julie Andrews) who is studying to be a nun in a convent and is sent to be a governess of the Von Trapp family by the Mother Abbess who feels that Maria would be more happy if she left the convent. During her stay, the Von Trapp family's lives begin to change forever. The dialogue is brilliant as every sentence suits each character and really brings them to life making you identify with them. The musical numbers are well-written and are some of the catchiest I've ever heard in a musical with songs such as \"Favourite Things\" and \"So Long, Farewell\" staying in my head for days and a beautiful score along with it. I also have to point out the engaging cinematography of Robert Wise who provides us with magnificent views of landscapes of the hills and mountains which really is the icing on the cake. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend anyone who loves cinema to watch this movie.\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music is one of the most beloved musical films of all time and a multiple Academy Award Winner, which features on both versions of the American Film Institute's list of the best American films ever made. In the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit that I don't especially like musicals, but even with that caveat the most surprising thing about The Sound of Music is not just that it's a bad film but that it's so bad it's painful to watch.\n",
      "Rogers and Hammerstein have a huge following, so clearly their twee, populist compositions with their facile lyrics clearly appeal to lots of people, but I'm not one of them. Leaving that aside however, the use of the musical numbers here has a sloppiness to it that smacks of laziness or bad script-editing. Thus, most of the songs are sung in context, as Maria - who by her own confession can't resist bursting into song - sings them either for her own pleasure or to teach the Von Trapp children to sing or the Von Trapp family performs them for them an audience. What makes no sense however are the two musical numbers performed by nuns, especially since the first is performed immediately after the script informs us that singing isn't permitted inside the abbey.\n",
      "The biggest problem with The Sound of Music however is that once you take away the songs, there's isn't much else left to recommend the film. Ted D. McCord's cinematography at least is impressive, from the famous aerial opening shot, which shows off the film's breathtaking locations and then closes in on Julie Andrews. He also makes extensive use of wide-angle and deep-focus shots, which effectively gives the actors a broad stage on which to perform, and the technical accomplishments of scenes such as the camera tracking the children and Maria cycling or riding on a carriage shouldn't be overlooked. The puppet show also boasts excellent sets, camerawork and choreography and the wedding of Maria and Georg is shot with a certain grandiosity. But on the other hand, the competent camerawork only serves to enhance the shallow artifice of director Robert Wise's gaudy mise-en-scéne.\n",
      "The story is based on the real life of the Von Trapp family, but the screenplay - adapted from Ernest Lehman from the stage play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse - simplifies this to the point of stupefying predictability and tedium, as misbehaving would-be nun Maria is sent to be governess of the Von Trapp children, wins them over and thaws the heart of their stern patrician father Georg Von Trapp, eventually marrying him. Naturally, the course of true love doesn't run smoothly and about a third of the way into the film, Eleanor Parker's Baroness Elsa von Schrader is introduced as a rival for Georg's affections, but even that produces little drama, since she is eventually prompted to nobly step aside in favour of Maria. In fact, the least predictable aspect of the story for those not already familiar with it is that the final third of the film shows the Von Trapp family fleeing the Nazis as their take over Austria, which on the one hand is not as tense or exciting as it sounds and yet on the other sits awkwardly with the rest of the film (although mercifully, in the face of Nazi oppression, the singing more or less stops).\n",
      "As if all of this were not bad enough, the acting isn't up to much either. Julie Andrews is the best thing in it, although the songs require her to sing at a pitch that is ear-piercing. The actors playing the seven Von Trapp children are variously wooden and stilted, whilst Christopher Plummer - who reportedly had to be talking into playing Georg and seems to have regretted it since - gives a performance that suggests he's as bored with the film as I was.\n",
      "Quite why The Sound of Music is so enduringly popular remains a mystery to me: it's saccharine, shallow, at least an hour too long and quite badly made. I would say that it couldn't be worse, but the sing-along version proves me wrong.\n",

It was never a childhood favorite of mine but my Mother always liked watching it so us kids did too. When I graduated high school I left home to go to college and a good 20 years passed before i saw it again. I was surprised upon seeing it as an adult and 30+ years after it's original release just how wonderful it is. It's definitely a polarizing film, and for those many critics the main and singular complaint seems to be that its too sweet, saccharin, unrealistic. I don't completely disagree with them, in many ways those charges can be levelled against most movie musicals. Frankly, that doesn't hold up for me. Sure, there's a little bit of fantasy here, but I do think its very well done. The sets, direction, story, are all excellent and make for a memorable and thoughtful viewing experience. This is a grand film worth seeing, or giving another viewing if you haven't see it in a long time.\n",

Miss Andrews seems to be doing another Mary Poppinesque role here, yet for some reason, I absolutely LOVE this film. I don't know if its the story, the magnificent photography, the high quality of the acting, the first class production values, or the songs{all of them are excellent}that do it for me. Prehaps I'm just a sucker for it, or prehaps it contains something that is lacking from today's hard sell high concept films. It takes me back to a more innocent age when the so-called family films were made with heart, class and intelligence. This one can make me feel good when I'm down and no matter how many times I've seen it, it always works.After all, isn't that what movie-going is supposed to be about? Highly recommended on all levels, they will never make 'em like this anymore.

      "Review Text: This musical exemplifies the meaning of the phrases ' timeless classic' and 'heartwarming family movie'. Although really sugary syrupy sweet, it never loses its appeal. Not normally a fan of musicals, I confess to preferring the two other famous ones of that era, My Fair Lady and Fiddler on the Roof. Yet, I still can't resist this old favorite every time it chances to be on TV.Of course it tells the story of the young postulant, Maria, who is sent as governess to the grand Salzburg manor of Captain Von Trappe, a retired Austrian naval officer with seven unruly children. Maria comes to care deeply for these motherless children and also their rigid, authoritarian father. Conflict arises as Maria has of course planned to take vows as a nun and the Captain is engaged to the Baroness, a lady of some sophistication. Both leading stars are brilliant in their roles, Julie Andrews as the outspoken young nun, and Christopher Plummer as the dashing Captain.This movie has it all...an engaging plot, touching love story, appealing children, political turmoil brewing, breathtaking mountain / lake scenery (Austrian Alps) splendidly photographed, and of course unforgettable music. My personal favorites are the inspiring 'Climb Every Mountain' and of course the touching 'Eidelweiss'.In terms of love stories, there are actually two of course. The more mature Captain and Maria declare their love ultra romantically (and musically) in a moonlit gazebo. Julie Andrews looks absolutely radiant in this scene. Also, there is the youthful romance between the Captain's oldest daughter, Liesl (who's '16 going on 17') and her young postman ('17 going on 18').This classic prevails partly, in my opinion, because of the integrity of its leading characters. Maria strives to do God's will, even if it should mean turning away from the man she loves in order to pursue her convent vocation. Incidentally, I was impressed by the portrayal of the nuns in this movie (especially the Mother Superior) as kind, serene servants of God (and not without humor), unlike the trend in modern movies to generally denigrate the clergy or those related thereto. As for Captain Von Trappe, he is loyal to the spirit of his beloved Austria, denouncing the Nazi occupation even at great personal expense. The film leads one to contemplate the reaction to the Anschluss many Austrians of that day must have had, if only in their hearts.I was thrilled in 1975 for an opportunity to visit Salzburg myself, a beautiful and charming city, and to see in person many of the scenes, churches, fountain etc. used in the filming of this movie. The Sound of Music is definitely an immortal classic, especially one you won't want your children to miss.\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound Of Music is one of my favorite things. You would have to be a cold-hearted cynic to dislike a movie as joyful as this. This movie is a cornerstone of my childhood and I love it even more now. What I especially love is how the cinematography takes advantage of the place the film is set in: the glorious Austrian Alps. And who could possibly forget the iconic opening scene? How the camera swoops all across the mountains and towns and lakes and fields and finally closes in on Julie Andrews circling around with her arms open. Also, the Blu-ray release is one of the best Blu-rays I've purchased.\n",

      "Review Text: I once saw an article in a magazine (was it FHM or MAXIM, can't remember), that listed this movie as one of the 50 worst films of all time. I would have thought it was just a joke, but then the list also contained Batman and Robin. I guess I don't know much about acting, directing, producing or even criticizing movies. One thing I can objectively say is that this movie was for me the most 'rewatchable'. I could watch it over and over again without being tired of it (my sister could actually recite the whole movie word for word). After that article in the men's mag ( and the fact that no movie, no matter how highly rated on the IMDb, is without a negative comment), I am forced to say again that I don't know what makes a movie good. I can however boldly say that this movie should automatically accompany every purchase of a VCR or DVD player!\n",

      "Review Text: The musical is not my genre of choice. I prefer classic film-noirs which are about as diametrically opposed to musicals as a genre can be. That said I enjoyed The Sound of Music immensely. The songs were very moving and fit the storyline perfectly. Speaking of the story, unlike the case in a lot of musicals, the plot in The Sound of Music does not exist simply to move the film from one musical number to another. It is a truly memorable romance story that will stay with viewer long after the viewing experience. The entire cast is superb (the kids are adorable!). This was Julie Andrew's coup de grace. It deserves all the accolades (including multiple Oscars) it has received. Strongly recommended, 9/10!\n",

      "Review Text: This is one of my favorite movies of all time, which is strange, because as a rule I avoid musicals. Happy, peppy people singing and dancing and clicking their heels with joy--give me a break! However, there are exceptions. I must be the only straight man with both this movie and \"The Wizard of Oz\" in his video library. There is a reason: Julie Andrews. She had that knack (rare these days) of being sexy in a wholesome way. \"The Sound of Music\" plays like an English-language version of the popular German/Swiss/Austrian genre the \"Heimatfilm\" (homeland film), generally wholesome family dramas set in the Alpine region full of blond, blue-eyed Frauleins, lonely goatherds, and lots of yodeling. Since Salzburg is the home town of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, it seems more plausible for people to spontaneously break into song and dance here than it does in a New York ghetto (\"West Side Story\") or an oppressed Jewish village in czarist Russia (\"Fiddler on the Roof.\") There are dark clouds on the horizon, however, and as the Anschluss approaches, Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) of the defunct Austrian Navy (Austria is landlocked now, but until World War I their empire included coastal regions of Italy and Croatia) must decide where to take his stand. He makes his sentiments clear by ripping in half a Swastika flag and flees with his family. This is an immensely enjoyable film filled with beautiful music and great choreography. It's corny, sappy, and shamefully manipulative--but what's wrong with that?\n",

Andrews plays a woman who wants to be a nun, but circumstances lead her to be a governess of a widower, Captain von Trapp (Plummer) and his seven children. The young children are very cute, but it's Andrew's performance that really got my attention. (Why didn't she get a Best Actress Award???????) Capt. von Trapp is a very stern man, and will not allow his children to have any fun of any kind. That is, until Maria shows up. They eventually fall in love, get married, and you just have to watch it again and again to really enjoy it. It's nearly three hours long, but it's worth every minute. I don't see how anyone with a brain could not like this movie. Watch it! You WON'T regret it!\n",

      "Review Text: This film is SO unbelievably good. It speaks volumes that after nearly 40 years people still love it and thousands of people still turn up to those sing-a-long things. It's just timeless in a way that nothing they turn out today is. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are perfect as the leading roles, they undergo such character development. The first half is mostly comedy, but the 2nd half takes a more dramatic turn, with scenes like the first kiss between Maria and Georg, the wedding (brings tears to my eyes - I WANT that dress!) and the symbolic mountain climbing. I agree with the person who said Maria and Georg's first kiss is very erotic. The way they kind of nuzzle is filled with sexual tension - they just want to jump each other's bones there and then! The photography is brilliant too. The scene that sticks in my mind is the overhead shot of the wedding, with Maria's huge train. It's magnificent. See it! If possible, go to the sing a long, they're so good.\n",

      "Review Text: This was a film which made me and other Indians of my generation actually listen to and love English songs. Earlier, to us English songs were unintelligible 'hooo' and 'haaaa', opera style. Now, 40 years after I first saw it (saw it in the cinema 5 times between 1967 and 1982)it remains sheer magic, the songs exquisite in the simplicity of the words and melodies. It is a film which has been rubbished both for its music and everything else, and yet it is perhaps my 2nd favorite film, English, Bengali and Hindi combined.The title is perhaps one of the most appropriate ones. The film is all about what music is and what it can do to one's life, and also what its absence can do.\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music has been, and probably always will be, one of my favorite films. While the historical discrepancies throughout the film are noticeable, and it does not correctly portray aspects of Austria during the time - that cannot be held accountable in the movie, because that is in fact what it is. A fictional movie based off of a Broadway musical. One cannot help but love the amiable and family-oriented film. Julie Andrews has a wonderful voice, and portrays the role of Maria as the optimistic nun who become nanny and then mother to the Von Trapp family well. Plummer, is not particularly my favorite character but he also portrays the captain in a decent manner.Wise is a experienced director and his experience is seen through the popularity and wonderful clips and action of the film. The songs of the movie are playful and fun to sing along with, and easily get stuck in your head.

      "Review Text: The Sound Of Music (1965): Starring Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Charmian Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Heather Menzes, Duanne Chase, Angela Cartwright, Debbie Turner, Kym Karath, Daniel Truhite, Richrd Haydn, Peggy Wood, Ben Wright.. Director Robert Wise, Music And Lyrics By Richard Rodgers The fist half of the 60's saw a great number of cinematic musicals, usually because the stage musicals had garnered immense popularity and because film directors and producers noted that film versions of the musicals would already have a target audience. Richard Roger's The Sound Of Music, together with \"My Fair Lady\", represent the height of that period in 60's cinema. The Sound Of Music is based on the true story of the Von Trapp family singers, who escaped Nazi Austria and made a living entertaining Americans and Europeans with their musical style. Naturally, the real story was fictionalized for the musical. Novitiate nun Fraulein Maria (Julie Andrews in her signature role) learns that she is not cut out for the life of a nun and her Mother Superior (Peggy Wood) quickly sends her away to work as a governess for the many children of Captain Georg Von Trapp, a retired and widowed naval captain. After the death of his first wife, he became bitter and shut out happiness, music and laughter in his home, which he runs like a ship. He is engaged to the glamorous but haughty, self-centered and un-motherly Baroness Schreider (Eleanor Parker). Maria provides the children with music lessons and liberates them from the repressive environment they've grown up with and soon they become attached to her. One thing leads to another, the Captain dumps the Baroness and marries Maria. Hitler takes over Germany and Austria and establishes his Third Reich, and the Nazis demand the Captain return to his post. But the Captain is anti-Nazi, making it clear he wants nothing to do with them, which sets off a chase. His life on the line, he escapes with Maria and the children to neutral Switzerland. This musical is bubbly and heart-warming, overly sentimental by today's standards(what family puts on puppet shows and sings acapella together along with a guitar ?) but represents a long-ago time when life was sweet and simple, and one in which family values was prioritized. This is a film the whole family can enjoy, and makes a regular appearance on ABC 7 around Christmas. British Broadway star Julie Andrews as Maria is in her element, providing the character with sweetness and girlish charm and truly this is her greatest role and one she will always be remembered for. The music is catchy, and the movie even manages to move us especially toward the end, when we sense the danger these people face when threatened by the Nazis. A good film, with strong performances, beautiful music and songs and a certain kind of nostalgic magic.\n",

      "Review Text: People like this movie because of the ideals it represents. Now a days it's a rarity to see such ideas being put forth in cinematic form. No Way! It was nearly in rare form when it came out.The Story is about Maria, a faithful believer in God. It starts with her trying to do her best at being a nun and failing. Thus, moving her into the story line of her finding her life. The music and the production are the backdrop to this.The production has nothing to do with real life Austria except that it's filmed on location there and the scenery is breathtaking. If you're from Europe or are German/Austrian you probably going to find the whole thing to be laughable if not offensively American. But it's a Hollywood film and the story and musical were written in America.In spite that, the production and direction of movie are very, very Well Done. Robert Wise new what he wanted from this movie and he stylized the whole thing to create a very nice pastel hues atmosphere to go along with the very Idealistic story.I read one reviewer who said that Andrews deserved an Oscar for her part. Blah! The parts were not that hard to act...the characters aren't dramatic. That being said, the actors in the movie were very fine actors and played their parts very well...Eleanor Parker, Chris plummer. If you watch the movie enough times, and you start paying attention to the faces of each character throughout the movie you realize everyone of them stays in character through out all of their scenes. especially Parker and Andrews. their faces are always reacting to exactly what's being said. It's just actors who know their craft and very good and superb direction.However, I don't know if anyone could have played the part as iconic-ally as Andrews did. I also don't think this movie would've been as popular had she not been the female actress to play the part. her sweet persona and voice just do the virtuous, honest Maria Von Trapp role so succinctly. She's truly beautiful in this movie.it's by no means a mind blowing drama. It's a very romantic movie (Happy Ideals being hyperbole-ed). It's the wholesomeness of this movie, the archetype \"Mother\" figure who comes in and saves the day that people really enjoy. They like the fantasy of it all very much to the point that I believe it gives them hope. Other critics laugh at it or are disgusted by it's over use of saccharin, but the movie's cultural following speaks for itself.The lyrics of the songs are Great. Climb Every Mountain is a beautiful song..if you really feel the message of that song, it will get you every time. I saw another reviewer complain about how ridiculous the scene between Maria and the Mother Superior was..\"could not take anymore\". I was like \"What?!\" that's like the best part of the whole movie. Such a wonderful scene of a nun in modern culture opening up and being vulnerable to a student..Leading by Example. The song is perfect in taking the place of the dialogue. Such a powerful moment in the movie.The one song in the entirety of the movie I don't like and wish they would have written differently is the \"somewhere\" song that the Captain and Maria use as a duet. I don't think the lyrics have anything to do with the movie and it's clear they created it to add to the kissing seen for the romance. I don't mind them singing together and enjoy the intimate romance of the moment but the song sucks. It needed different lyrics.In the end, I believe this movie deserved the best picture Oscar in 64...I do not think the actress needed any nods. their parts weren't that difficult. But putting everything together, it all made for quite a very well done movie. Especially for a musical. One of the most mature and professionally made musicals ever to be produced.\n",

      "Review Text: I don't want to rain on anyone's parade here. I know TSOM is alleged to be one of the greatest musicals ever. That's why I (finally) watched it last week on DVD with my wife, who is a huge TSOM fan.Now that I have seen it, I don't get it. I admit up front that I have never been a big fan of musicals. When I was a kid and a song broke out in a cartoon, I usually lost interest. That hasn't changed.But even allowing for that, *this* is a classic film beloved by millions? Why? I mean, the setting is gorgeous, granted. And the actors do OK. But the plot, the pacing, even the music ... is this any better than most other musicals?My DVD player said this movie was almost three hours long. But *nothing happens* until you've watched it for 2 hours and 23 minutes (that's when the Nazi threat comes in). Until that point, here is the plot (and I don't think this is a spoiler for anyone, though maybe some people who haven't seen TSOM, like me until last week, might expect more): Former war captain who lives in inexplicably huge house in Austria with his seven kids and no wife meets former nun who starts as nanny and they fall in love and get married. That's it! More than two hours of kids singing, the nanny singing, the kids and nanny singing while they play, and increasingly loving looks and conversations between the captain and the nanny (though few of them compared to the singing). This plot could have occurred in less than an hour. There is very little original, or new, it. It is very, very slow. There is a minor B plot about a rich woman the captain is engaged to who bows to the inevitable and agrees to end the engagement. But that's all.There is no conflict (which most stories revolve around) until 2 hours and 23 minutes in, when the local townspeople who join the Nazis make a move. Then, when it gets interesting, the movie ends in less than 30 minutes after that point! Amazing! It ended with the family cresting a mountain and I said out loud, \"That is IT?!\" I expected much more. Watching a movie with no conflict (and the relationship between the nanny and the captain is hardly a conflict) is like idly following a river's current, with no destination in mind. If you like that kind of aimlessness, great. But if you want something that will hold your interest, and you don't enjoy aimless wandering, then TSOM isn't for you.Also, I thought the musical was amateurish in scenes that required background music. About 90 percent of the time, when two actors were having a discussion and music played in the background, that music was the melodies from various songs used elsewhere in the movie, one after another! So you are watching what is supposed to be a touching scene between the captain and the nanny outside at night, and under the dialogue is \"The hills are alive, with the sound of muuuuuuuusiiiiccccc!\" and \"Edel-weisssss, Edel-weissssssss,\" and other tunes over and over. It was *extremely* distracting. I kept trying to listen to the dialogue but my mind was filling in the words to the melodies underneath it. Couldn't the film have used the same notes as background music but dropped the melodies? It seemed very odd. I can't remember ever hearing that before in a movie, or being so distracted by it.I'm puzzled by this love for TSOM. So many people care for this film, there must be *something* to it. But I'm not sure what it is. I do know that the people I know who like TSOM are all women. Most of my male friends haven't even seen it (other than snippets on TV now and then). Maybe it's a gender thing. In any case, I gave TSOM a 5. Don't shoot me!\n",

It is set in Austria, where the views are breath taking, and from the moment Julie Andrews comes waltzing into view, singing about the hills, to the very end, the film has the audience entranced. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are great in their roles as the novice nun and sea captain, and whoever said Andrews couldn't act obviously hadn't seen this film. The songs are great and you find yourself singing about deers and yodeling for days to come, and although the film is quite lenghty at nearly three hours, you barely realise, as the film never loses its pace for a minute. Anyone who hasn't seen this film, has obviously had a very deprived childhood, as its one of the greatest films of the 20th century, and will no doubt captivate audiences for years to come.\n",

It wasn't some rich Hollywood-fellow with a big cigar who invented this family. They are true! The songs are great, and after seeing the movie twice, you are able to sing along with most of them. I don't have a favorite song, because one song isn't a song without the others. Perhaps the love story is a bit phony, but that is how the romantics like it. It gives us a bit of hope, that love is out there, and we can get it too... even though we're only poor nuns, with a simple guitar ;)\n",

      "Review Text: This is without a doubt the best movie ever made (second is 'From Here to Eternity'). Julie Andrews lights up the screen as Maria, the freewheeling nun from Nonnberg Abbey who is hired as a governess to look after Captain von Trapp's seven children. After winning the hearts of the children through song and freedom from the oppressive life their autocratic widower father (Christopher Plummer) has made them lead, she proceeds to win the heart of the Captain himself. The love story in this masterpiece is probably one of the best in cinematic history~ there are several moments when you feel that ripping each other's clothes off would be less romantic than the raw sexual tension that charges the air, particularly during their fight right after the Captain comes home and the incredibly romantic Laendler. All I can say is that if you haven't seen this movie, you must have been living under a rock for the past fifty years.\n",

      "Review Text: The movie \"The Sound of Music\" is one of the uplifting musicals that Hollywood created in the 60s. Similar to \"Hello Dolly\" and \"Mary Poppins\", these films did not mirror the political and social upheavals of the era, but rather served as a retreat from reality into the realm of fiction. The musical \"West Side Story\" stands out as an exception, being the first to portray the Latino community in New York and delve into their political issues.\"The Sound of Music\" has been subject to criticism for its portrayal of politics. The film's protagonist, Captain von Trapp, resists Nazism, but his opposition is not rooted in its antisemitism, militarism, or authoritarianism. Rather, his primary concern is the threat Nazi Germany poses to Austrian sovereignty.Furthermore, the film has been criticized for its lack of racial diversity.\n",

      "Review Text: If there was one movie that stood out from all other movies it would have to be \"The Sound of Music.\" From the beautiful acting to the amazing singing it has that \"wow\" factor. Maria played by the hugely talented Julie Andrews and Captain von Trapp played by the wonderful Christopher Plummer. This is one movie I can see why people call it a timeless classic because that was it is.The story is so beautifully written with Maria and the gorgeous Captain slowly falling in love. It's so wonderful to watch. In one scene a dance scene at the end you can see the sexually chemimstry between Captain and Maria just wanting to come out. In another scene just before the Captain tells Maria he loves her, the Barnoss has come out onto the balcony and you can see that the Captain doesn't want her there. I also love the gazebo & the wedding scene - the church is amazing.This is a beaitiful movie and a timeless classic and anyone who says it isn't well can you show me why?\n",

      "Review Text: possible spoiler.I love old musicals, and I love the music in Sound of Music. And there's nothing wrong with the acting. But the movie is basically garbage. Maria Von Trapp wanted to sue the producers but found she had sold away this right. She loved the broadway play, but the movie completely distorted the facts of her life and her autobiography. Her husband was actually a gentle, loving father and husband, for starters. And the ending is a complete Hollywood fiction. The family actually left for America on a steamship with a contract for the family to tour the country giving performances. So much for dad Von Trapp despising singing. Christopher Plummer referred to it as \"The Sound of Treacle.\" It's a great movie for children. But these adults who go gaga over it really should read Maria Von Trapp's autobiographies (in two volumes). The true story is much more interesting, and a much more inspiring testament to faith and fate.\n",

Why do a remake when its only going to go down like the titanic loll because it wont have Julie Andrews and please don't forget good old Chrisphor Plummer as well. But knowing the general public they will be fickle and go and watch it and see what the film is like. Its bad enough Andrew Lloyd Webber is doing a stage production and looking for a Maria on TV. I think he thinks he cant do no wrong but I think he will get his comeuppance with this one hopefully. Why dose he have have to do remake all the time,has he forgotten how to write a play of his own.\n",

After reading a few dozen IMDB reviews, I have to say that just about ALL the comments, good and bad, are fairly accurate. My personal favorite is indy-39's theory that Christopher Plummer's character has \"caused more women to enter into dysfunctional relationships and lead lonely lives in search of an unattainable male (gay?) than any other character in film history.\" At last, a plausible explanation for the wasteland of my single years.I have nothing as profound to say, but here is what I can offer:1) I am devoted to Miss Andrews' \"Mary Poppins\" 2) I am devoted to Mr. Wise' \"West Side Story\" 3) I will see both of those films again and again before I kick off 4) I will not see \"The Sound of Music\" againCapiece?\n",

      "Review Text: I have watched this movie more than any other movie. It has been a personal favourite since I was 3 and I have never become sick of it. The movie is so charming, enjoyable and utterly watchable.Julie Andrews is divine in the role of the outspoken wannabe-nun, Maria, who becomes a governess for 7 children in a slightly dysfunctional household. She has one of the most beautiful singing voices you will ever hear and her singing appears utterly effortless. She is a lovely actress and has so much screen presence.Christopher Plummer is wonderful as the seemingly cruel (but actually just desperately sad and overwhelmed following the death of his wife) Captain who relearns how to love, laugh, appreciate his children and sing with the help of Maria. According to some reports, he hated making the film, but you would certainly not be able to tell - his performance is sincere and heartwarming.Each of the seven children is lovely and sweet. They are all capable singers, dancers and actors. It is great how they are so featured in the film, and don't just disappear when they are not 'important to the story' as happens in so many films! This is such a heartwarming, tender and compassionate story, based on the life of the Von Trapp family. I was thrilled to be able to go to the Sing-along-Sound-of-Music and see how many people - old, young and in between - are still enjoying the magic that Robert Weiss created so many years ago.Even if you do not like the idea of this film, or do not enjoy it, I believe that it is a film that should be seen by all. It is a piece of motion picture history. A true classic!\n",

Yes, but so is the king in \"The King & I\". Even with all the similarities, I like this movie.  I really like the dance where Liesl & Rolf are in the gazebo during the rainfall, singing \"Sixteen Going On Seventeen\".  When I see old brocade curtains, I think of Maria/Julie making matching \"ugggly\" clothing for all the children, even the boys!  My boys would not wear those clothes to a dogfight!  However, it works for this movie.  Good thing Maria taught the kids to sing.  Didn't that become their livelihood when they got to this country, in real life?\n",

I thought Christopher Plummer did a great job, especially in the beginning when he was still unhappy. I could really laugh at those grimaces he made. The parts of the story I like most are from when Maria (Julie Andrews) starts working at the von Trapp house until she leaves (mostly though the scenes with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer) and the part from the return of Capt. von Trapp returns from his honeymoon until the end. The rest is too merry and uninteresting. The movie is a bit too long as well, but heck it is not bad.6,5 out of 10\n",

      "Review Text: Maria is a young lady studying to be a nun, but is unsure of convent life, as her whole personality, her whole way of living is very different from every other nun in the Abbey. She is sent away to be a governess to seven children, of the Von Trapp family. Their father, Captain Georg Von Trapp, is a widower and very harsh on his children, treating them like he would do to his naval army. When Maria arrives she changes this, and brings music and laughter into the household, but not even Maria can change all the events that are about to come...Many have grown up with this movie, and I am one of them. As a child I loved The Sound Of Music, and I still do. A timeless classic, The Sound Of Music can be watched again and again. It is a universal movie, and there is a squeaky clean plot. No sex, no drugs, and no violence. Perfect for family audiences.This was the second film I saw with Julie Andrews, and I loved her more in this movie than I have with any of her other films. This is my favourite role of hers. She was the perfect Maria - her smile, her kindness, her attitude and confidence, and her angelic and enchanting voice. She looked beautiful, and her chemistry with Christopher Plummer was indeed wonderful. He was a good Captain Von Trapp, though he started off a bit rocky in my opinion. But his performance greatly improved throughout and by the end I could not imagine anyone else in his role. The children, every single one of them, delivered fine performances. They had exceptional singing voices, considering their age, and kudos to their choreographer for their dance sequences, especially in \"Do-Re-Mi\" and \"So Long Farewell\", which they were brilliant in.I strongly believe the popularity of The Sound Of Music is mainly to the outstanding musical score by Roger and Hammerstein, but there are more factors to consider. For example, the gorgeous scenery, the acting (Julie Andrews owns this film), the universal family appeal, or maybe even the values that the film embraces. They are so decent. The popularity factor could be due of any one of these, however I believe it was the music. Each song is so wonderfully crafted. I cannot choose a favourite out of the songs, but I have always had a soft spot for \"Do-Re-Mi\". I never really liked the song \"Edelweiss\" as a child, but now when I listen to it, I love it. It is highly underrated. \"My Favourite Things\" is a great song, very catchy, and really exposes Andrews' beautiful singing voice. \"The Lonely Goatherd\" also did that, but this time with...brace yourselves...PUPPETS! I remember watching that song over and over again and giggling with my family at the puppets and the yodeling - a lovely memory. I also think \"Something Good\", and \"I Have Confidence\" are nice songs, and the same goes for \"So Long Farewell\", with the children. And I cannot forget the outstanding choreography and singing in \"Sixteen Going On Seventeen\", Liesl and Rolf's chemistry in that song was cuter than a cocker spaniel.There are many subplots in The Sound Of Music, like the romance with Liesl and Rolf, the war and escaping, the Baroness's entry into the lives of the Von Trapps, the singing competition, Maria's trouble in the convent...but the main story would be of the family, and their story together.Definitely one of my 'favourite things'!\n",

      "Review Text: ...due to the way the songs are framed.  This, I formerly thought, was the last musical of its kind (post-1920's Hollywood standard) but later realized it's a transitional point in the change from past standards to a more stark and spare approach, be it the stylized method of \"Yentl\" to the MTV-oid manner of the di Caprio Romeo/Juliet redo.  In \"Sound Of Music\", the story is a frame for the songs in higher relief than previous film, but in lesser relief than in Streisand's work, where the character lines meld with the songs.    The film, of course, has value above technique, showing an earlier, less crass approach to dating than today's, and in a modern, accessible language. It manages as well to note the potential terrors of wars past, along with the almost nineteenth-century lack of moroseness and pessimism that probably explains Europe's survival through that period.\n",

Maria scampers back to the nunnery where Mother Inferior jerks her around by sending her right back to the country estate so she can find the true meaning of her feelings.... or something like that.This noisy chick flick made a lot of money at the box office, but it's really not that good.

      "Review Text: Great musical with Julie Andrews. Set in 1938 with the Nazis closing in on Austria, the story centres on free spirited Maria whom the nuns fear doesn't quite fit in. She is sent to oversee the seven children of former Naval officer Captain von Trapp. He is a widow who uses strict military discipline on the children, who respond by rebelling against every nanny hired. Maria holds strong allowing her friendly patient demeanor to win the children over. Eventually von Trapp is also won over when he overhears her influence through his children singing a song she taught them. They are soon sought after to sing at an event that has Nazis in attendance. Wonderful music full of life and joy, flawed only by the underdeveloped personalities of the children. Robert Wise previously had musical success with West Side Story but goes beyond that here. As in Mary Poppins, Julie Andrews shines as a nanny but of a different nature here. Christopher Plummer as von Trapp learns the importance of family. Eleanor Parker plays a wealthy potential wife to von Trapp.\n",

Maria, the nun turned governess, is played by the lovely Julie Andrews. Andrews is remarkable in her role as the governess of the seven von Trapp children. She has never looked more beautiful, or sounded more wonderful, than in this musical classic. She presents her emotions with great feeling, especially in the sequence (part 2) by the gazebo with the Captain. \"I must've done something good...\"The Captain, played by stage actor Christopher Plummer, is a stern man who appears to have no heart. Plummer presents this facade perfectly, and displays his range between stony to sincere when the Captain hears the children singing and begins to sing along with them. You can see the Captain's love for his children in this scene, and when he sings \"Edelweiss\" with his oldest daughter, Liesl.The children are a pack of wonderful, talented, good-looking individuals (Charmian, Nicholas, Heather, Duane, Angela, Debbie, and Kym). I was so interested to find out what these people are doing today, so I bought Charmian Carr's book, \"Forever Liesl\". It was a very good book, and worthwhile read. I learned so much about what went on in the movie when i read it.This movie...I don't know...it seems like the type of movie that people would make fun of, yet no one dares to. Maybe that is because we can all relate to this movie in one way or another. I sure can. It has changed my life in the most positive way.

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music is a movie adaptation of a musical based on the true story of the von Trapp family. Maria is a young wannabe nun who is hired by Captain von Trapp to be the governess for his 7 children. Eventually they fall in love and are married. When the Nazis try to forcefully enlist Captain von Trapp to their navy, he and his family are forced to flee Austria. The movie has stunning footage of the Austrian Alps and catchy songs, but I feel that it is too outdated to receive a higher review. My main issue is that von Trapp is old enough to be Maria's dad. The culture and time in the movie is just too different from today to be relatable. In addition, the 3 hour movie felt too slow and could sometimes be quite tedious. It is the sort of movie you watch once just for the sake of watching it.\n",

      "Review Text: I resisted watching \"The Sound of Music\" for many years. The plot sounded too sickly sweet to me. Once I finally broke down and watched this movie from beginning to end, I realized that the movie was sickly sweet, but it was also so compelling and the songs were so catchy that it was impossible to resist this movie. I know you just can not wait to hear me tell you whether you should have this movie in your collection, so I will tell you now that you should. This movie initially centers on Maria, played by Julie Andrews in one of her first film roles. Maria is a novitiate at an Abbey in Austria. Though Maria is earnest, being a nun seems a poor fit with Maria's outgoing and gregarious personality. The Mother Abbess, played by Peggy Wood in one of the final roles of her career, wisely decides that Maria needs a different perspective on life before facing the decision to take her vows. The Mother Abbess sends Maria to the Von Trapp family to be the children's governess. We quickly discover that Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, is a strict disciplinarian. We immediately see the primary conflict in this movie, one which can only lead to love and marriage as the two dominant personalities recognize that they need the strength of each other to survive in the world. However, before we get to the excitement that happens later in the movie, Maria needs to remind Captain Von Trapp that families are not armies, and that children need love, not marching and saluting. In the background of the main story is Nazi Germany's ambition of empire that led to the Anschluss or annexation of Austria into Greater Germany. Captain Von Trapp was a strong Austrian nationalist and was very opposed to the Anschluss. World events and Nazi Germany's insistence that Captain Von Trapp become a part of the German navy soon overshadow the honeymoon of Maria and Captain Von Trapp. The end of this movie must count as one of the most awe-inspiring endings ever filmed in a musical. Every scene with Julie Andrews is a treat. Andrews lights up the screen with her presence and her singing, fully justifying the Academy Award nomination she received for best actress in 1966 and the awards she won from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, and the Laurel Awards. Andrews' four octave singing voice is the vocal anchor that provides the basis for many of the charming and frequently beautiful songs. The songs range from soaring to sweet and catchy. Among these songs are \"Edelweiss,\" \"The Lonely Goatherd,\" \"My Favorite Things,\" \"Do-Re-Mi\" and the title song. Though Julie Andrews was certainly a powerful force in this movie, the other stars helped complement Andrews' considerable talents. Christopher Plummer was outstanding as Captain Von Trapp, though he looks back on his role in this movie with distaste. The children were outstanding, and did an excellent job of singing and acting. Some of the children have gone on to extensive acting careers, others left acting after only this movie or a few roles to other activities. Eleanor Parker was awesome as Baroness Schraeder, the woman we all loved to hate because she came between Maria and the Children and the Captain. I will provide a brief word about the sound and the picture. I thought the sound was excellent, but I only have a 50\" television with stereo speakers. I do not have surround sound connected. The sound was very good though I have some issues with lower frequency reproduction (I guess I need a subwoofer). I have a bigger issue with picture quality. The color keeps shifting between scenes. In some scenes the color is excellent. In other scenes, the color seems off. At first I thought something was wrong with my television, but I checked the quality of the picture against other inputs and realized that the problem was the DVD itself. The color shifts are often subtle, but in a few places they are annoying. I hope future releases have this problem fixed. This movie routinely makes top ten lists of the greatest musicals, as well it should. This movie may fall short of being a perfect movie, but I am unable to suggest how it could have been any better. I have watched multiple releases of this movie multiple times and regardless of the quality of the release, I watch each time almost as though I had never seen the movie before. You must have this movie in your collection, especially if you are a romantic at heart or have a family. Enjoy!\n",

      "Review Text: Possible Spoilers This has been my favorite movie for, gosh, about 10 years now.  (Considering I'm 19 going on 20, that's an accomplishment.)  I always thought it was great-it made me fall in love with Julie Andrews' talents and taught me about chemistry between romantic leads.  (\"Mommy, the Baroness and the Captain don't GO together-he goes better with Maria.\")  My roommate was in the chorus of the play at her hometown civic theater over the summer, and we watched the video of one of her performances.  Their play, taken almost directly from the original Broadway version, was obviously different than the film, including a few different songs and a totally different way of Maria and George falling in love.  Seeing the play, aside from giving me new ways to lovingly torture my roommie (\"1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3 step together! now step-hop...\"), has only made me appreciate the movie even more.  I never gave Ernest Lehman, the film's screenwriter, enough credit.  The play dialogue really wasn't that good-VERY schmaltzy (if you think the movie's bad, you haven't heard anything yet).  The love scene came across very differently-not as playful or subtle as the movie.  It just wasn't as good, let's just put it that way.  The movie has great actors and a fantastic writer doing what they do best, and though the score helps, I now see that a great score doesn't a great musical make.  That and the scenary-thank you to whoever made that cast and crew go to Austria-brilliant move on your part. This movie will remain my favorite, and my mother's, for years to come.\n",

His answer, \"It was the first time in my life that I rooted for the Nazis!\"I saw \"The Sound of Music\" on stage years ago, and it ran a little over 2 hours. This monstrosity of a film runs almost 3 hours. Talk about padding, and they even cut some of the songs from the stage version.

Now, you may ask - \"What's my problem with the film?\" Well, if you ask me, the film could've been shorter. I think film's three-hour run-time really hinders it, and causes it to loose a lot of it's momentum it had in the beginning. The film does have good songs and descent sets, it's just it's at point, a bit of a snooze fest.

I commented that the action heroine may not be a likely role (as there are in reality few action heroes).  I pointed out that a female heroine might take a different role, ie, she might be a nun, use singing as a weapon, and outmaneuver the Nazi regime while saving her family and husband.   The \"Sound of Music\" probably doesn't make many of the action movie lists; yet it certainly has an active, female lead who is a heroine.\n",

      "Review Text: I've always loved musicals, and this movie is a great example of a great musical. It has great songs and great scenery (and awesome reviews!) and a great cast. Julie Andrews is an awesome actress (my personal favorite) and she did an awesome job. Some of my friends don't like it because they say it's too sappy or too sing-songy or too young, but it's got a wonderful plot and it's not too sappy at all, and I don't think that two people falling in love makes for a young movie at all. Some people I know don't like My Fair Lady for the same reason (did you know that Sister Sophia, the nun with the cute face, is the singing voice for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady?) but I adore My Fair Lady, too, though not as much as Sound of Music. Henry Higgins and Eliza fall in love but neither one really wants to admit it, because Henry Higgins said he'd never fall in love and is too proud to take back his words, and Eliza is understandably exasperated with his complacency and rudeness. Almost the same, the captain and Maria fall in love, but neither wants to admit it, Maria because she is training to be a nun and if she becomes one she can't have him and is a bit confused by her feelings, and the captain because he's engaged to the Baroness. (How he ever fell in love with Baroness Schraeder to begin with with somebody as gorgeous and nice as Maria right there is beyond me, but hey, all men are kind of stupid at times.) I just love this movie.\n",

Tours run from the town centre which, alas, I could not fit in when visiting in 2004.

Yes, the story is corny and the movie has to be one of the most sentimental of all but it has the truly magnificent songs of Rogers and Hammerstein to compensate. The photography is truly breathtaking at times with superb production values throughout. This and Doctor Zhivago were my favourite films when I was growing up in the sixties and I  have seen it countless times.Eventually I grew up and became into  adult movies like The Godfather etc. but The Sound of Music brings back many pleasant memories. It was a world of colour and adventure. Sheer escapism for a kid growing-up in rainy industrial Scotland. One thing I know for sure is that Julie Andrews, while not quite a babe,was certainly far too good-looking to be a nun.Also the fact that the hills were alive with the sound of music remains equally valid in our own present times.\n",

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music is my most favorite movie ever!I saw it for the first time when i was 5yrs old and know all the songs and all the dialogue. It is the movie that i can watch everyday without getting bored. My kids love it too, my 12yr old son can play the backing music of all the songs on the piano! I always make him play them so I can sing along with them. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, \"The Sound of Music\", \"Do-Re-Mi\" or \"Edelweiss\"(which is my favorite) . Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken nun turned governess. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965. The Sound of Music\" is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.\n",

      "Review Text: I always thought that an operetta or a musical film should contain fairly fast moving action,choruses,humor, perhaps some uniforms,catchy music and singing talent. \"The Sound of Music\" contains only some of these.There are uniforms but not necessarily ones you'd want to run into.They're not Austrian Hussars,Russian officers,Mounties, but Nazis at the time of the Anschluss. Nor are they the most exciting voices: the Mother Superior exhorts,somewhat out of place, the \"Climbing of every Mountain\", the Baron (or Count),if he does at all, sings in an uninteresting bland voice; Julie Andrews is no Lily Pons or Kathryn Grayson, or even Jeanette MacDonald,but vocalizing in \"Pediatric\".walks us through her favorite places where \"the dog bites\" or \"the bee stings\". \"When you're sixteen\" etc. is rather insipid, and the nuns' chorus is on the juvenile side. The Baroness acts insecure rather than malicious and the whole cast of characters is not more than unidimensional. The photography and scenery are excellent,but apart from this I would feel that this is a children's picture; perhaps that was what was intended.\n",

      "Review Text: Hey, its not Lost Horizon!The Sound of Music is a colorful bloated bland musical that Julie Andrews does not really fit. I was never convinced she was a nun, or wanted to be a nun; she was just Julie Andrews pretending to want to be a nun.I don't know my history very well, but this was probably made after she lost the role of Elisa Dolittle in the movie version of My Fair Lady. I think she was still miffed.The movie is OK, its like a big loaf of white bread that has no texture. But it could be worse; we could have Ross Hunter and Burt Bacharach and a troop of truly no talent people banging around the stage dodging polar bears and ferns at the top of the world! The Sound of Music is a good movie for insomniacs.\n",

Julie Andrews had a beautiful voice that is unmatched in this day and age as far as musical films are concerned. It's sad that she cannot sing anymore because of her throat surgery but she is still a great actress. The movie has it all with a great soundtrack that I will never forget the words to. Every song on this movie is a song that is full of life and is enjoyable to listen to. So take time from your busy lives to stop what you're doing, close your eyes and listen, I mean REALLY LISTEN.

      "Review Text: The Sound of Music is my favorite movie of all time. In front of the television in my living room, I grew up with the majesty of the Alps, splendor of the Aigen Von Trapp family home and the beauty of a family falling in love with their governess Maria. The real-life story of the Von Trapp family was portrayed through the phenomenal acting by many iconic names in Hollywood. The main character, Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is introduced to her audience as a postulant at an Austrian abbey. Maria realizes the abbey is not a good fit for her as her overseer Mother Abbess, Peggy Wood, decides to send her to work as a governess for Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp, Christopher Plummer, and his seven rambunctious children. The acting, directing, music, cinematography, costume design and historical significance combine to produce the greatest musical of all time.The musical is almost three hours long, but the superb acting will make you lose track of time. Maria soon forms a bond with the children as she teaches them about song, and most importantly how music can affect your daily lives. Maria and the children's bond and friendship grows strong, but Maria and the Captain soon begin to fall for one another. Another woman, Baroness Elsa Schraeder, played by Eleanor Parker, tries to get in the way. True love triumphs in the end, as Maria brings a joyless household together and gives the Von Trapp family a home. When everything seems to be a happy ending, the Nazis seize control of Vienna and the Von Trapp family must escape or the father will be forced to be commissioned in the Third Reich.The Sound of Music was directed like watching painting come to life. The director, Robert Wise, was able to beautifully bring different elements, neutral colors and soft tones into each scene, engulfing the viewer. Some argue that some scenes are too drawn out, giving too much to the audience, when a little less could be shown and would make the scene flow smoother, but I disagree. This story is one that deserves to be taken in moment by moment and not to be rushed.The cinematography in this movie is stunning, with countryside views of Austria, beautiful European city streets, majestic mountains everywhere you look, and shots of the Villa Trapp, the real-life home of the Von Trapp family.Costume design was done amazingly well, from authentic ballroom dresses and tuxes to the play clothes made from curtains. Design in film is always something I'm critiquing. It's one of the most important elements to place the viewer in simply a good story or bring you directly into that reality. The colors and patterns of the clothes are incorporated as part of the overall mood. The designers researched the trends and styles of that decade and made the movie come alive.Throughout the movie the foreshadowing does not quite prepare the audience of the horror that Austria is about to face. The Third Reich is about to take over Austria and Captain Von Trapp and his associates continually discuss the changes that they are happening. The last act is where the Von Trapp family must flee their home and country. Here the film switches mood completely, once light-hearted and lively now to suspenseful and wary. Some viewers find the pacing of the film difficult, even confusing. The drastic change is appropriate for what was happening to many Austrian families at this time. The Sound of Music is based on a true story and real life rarely has just happy endings.If getting catchy songs in your head isn't your cup of tea with jam and bread, I would suggest to keep looking. But if you want to get caught up in a wonderful story told through mesmerizing scenes of song and laughter. Like me, you have found the movie musical for you! It \"Trapps\" me every time I watch it! A movie that has something for everyone, a true masterpiece, the Sound of Music!\n",

Not being gay or Austrian, I don't know much about musicals or Vienna, so I didn't really expect to find much in this movie for me. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much. In fact, I would be willing to say that this is Christopher Plummer's best performance, and I liked Julie Andrews more here than in Mary Poppins or 10, which are the only other movies I've seen her in. I recommend this movie to just about everyone, especially gay Austrians.\n",

It is a film about love, and I believe in love! Music is wonderful, Julie Andrews and Chris Plummer give us a beautiful interpretation, Salzburg is a wonderful city...what else could I say? I don't like musicals, but this one is something different:music doesn't seem to enter by force or \"by mistake\" in this story!

Simply, it's a lovely, peaceful film, and it makes me feel alive, alive in a restful suburb of Salzburg, Austria full of love, hope, optimism, and patriotism.Providing more sap than a forest full of Vermont maples, it has a basic plot, sweet story, and unbelievably sugary characters, but people have stuck to it as saccharin, and praise it as an iconic timeless musical. It won 5 Oscar awards in 1966 also ( I wished I'd known it before to have a higher expectation of this film :)))\n",

      " well, what can I say? And why should I bother? If any movie were ever critic-proof, it's this one. In fact, famed critic Pauline Kael was fired for daring to write a bad review of it when it first came out. Julie Andrews sure worked her mojo on that one.Funny thing is: The Sound of Music doesn't need protection from critics. Yes, it's schmaltzy, but it's not nearly as schmaltzy as, say, Titanic. Yes it has all those adorable kids and all those adorable songs and even a cute puppet show stuck right in the middle of it, but it also has grit, drama, and some harrowing moments. Hell, it's got Nazis racing around in big black cars! It is a total cinematic experience, and one that benefits greatly from technological advances that let you enjoy its lavish sights and sounds on a big TV screen with big surround speakers that make it feel like Julie Andrews is embracing your or the Nazis are sneaking up on you from behind.\n",

      "Review Text: I really expected a lot from this film... I really did. I remember the jovial excitement popping the DVD in on Christmas Eve to view, from what I had heard, to be Rogers & Hammerstein's Crowning Achievement. And, why should I have been led to think otherwise, when surveying all the evidence to be seen before me? Its immense popularity and following, the seemingly countless honors bestowed upon the film by AFI & the Acadamy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, the endless use of the songs in every medium of entertainment (be it homage or parody), etc. And, I admit, I recall being mesmerized by the amazing shot zooming across the breathtaking Austrian Mountains swooping in on an enthusiastic and lovely Julie Andrews. Just as grand as what I had been told to expect. However, as the film progressed, I sensed more than a couple things wrong with it that made it more than difficult to watch all the way through.Ultimately, \"The Sound of Music\" has difficulty asking itself the universal question that all great films do. Why does this story need to be told? Other alleged \"great\" musicals, such as \"West Side Story\", \"Wizard of Oz\", \"King & I\", \"Mary Poppins\", heck even \"Grease\" are chief conveyors of how this can be done right and effectively. They are actually \"about\" something, and they make the viewers know it. \"Sound of Music\" seems content to simply sit back and settle for the typical \"follow your heart\" message. Even then, that hardly holds any weight at all by the end of the film, considering the decisions made by the Von Trapp family on behalf of themselves and their own safety, and no one else's.Everything wonderful about this film, it seems, stems from its success as a musical on Broadway and not from anything special in the film itself. The acting is wooden, the choreography unoriginal, the voice dubbing obvious and sloppy, the songs added for the film hardly memorable or containing the same kick as the ones written with Hammerstein's help (although, \"I Have Confidence in Me\" gets stuck in one's head quite easily). The cinematography is, admittedly, quite beautiful, but appearance isn't everything, you know. Looking under that thin layer of sparkling cinematography is nothing special or particularly complex, especially compared to \"The King & I\", which has often drawn comparasin and which usually ends up taking a backseat to \"Sound\" in the \"greatness\" department for some odd reason.I would ultimately be content calling this a \"good\" film and accentuating all of its wonderful qualities if it did not already enjoy a massive following for those very reasons. It is not a horrible film, I am not calling it one. I am calling it overrated and certainly not one of the \"greatest films\" ever made.\n",

I love how uplifting it is, and even with some drama in it, it has a happy ending. I own the new anniversary DVD that just came out, and the soundtrack, which I hope to keep for eternity. Julie Andrews is still amazing, and so is the rest of the cast. The lyrics are astounding, and so colorful. I really suggest this movie to all that enjoy musicals, and who want to learn a little bit on history as well. Trust me on this, rent the movie. Your home television screen, will truly come alive, with the sound of music.\n",

      "Review Text: Although this is one of the better translations from stage to screen it still suffers from the curse of the movie musical. Some of the better (funnier) musical numbers have been left out of the film. A visually stunning film that carries the basic story line form stage to screen, there is just something missing as far as the overall musical is concerned. Leaving out the number done by Max and the Baroness is akin to leaving \"I'm Calm\" out of \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\". It leaves a hole in the whole.\n",

      "Review Text: This movie is by far the best musical I've ever seen. I've seen this movie over and over and over again. The songs are legendary you're bound to have heard at least one of them if you haven't watched this movie. The songs are so catchy and the rhythm makes you want to dance and sing a long with the movie.Summary: This movie isn't just a musical, but it's also a love story, and a little suspense in the settings. I don't want to spoil ANYTHING, but the time setting is during WWII with Nazism. There is a little suspense, but it's mostly a love/musical story. If you classical catchy tunes, this is the movie to watch. I for one love watching this movie and I still watch it.\n",

I also was invested in the suspense between the Nazis and Georg. I also liked seeing the bond between the kids and Maria grow as they went from not liking her to loving her. The way that the story connects is really smooth going from Georg's \"friend\" wanting him to throw a party to then tell him that the Nazis are planning to invade. It was very weird seeing it go from them singing and having a good time to the Nazis invading though but i guess that is how reality is.\n",

With cute but not amazing movies like Toy Story and The Incredibles taking up space on the top 250, I am stumped as to why The Sound of Music did not qualify.Beautiful songs, heartfelt acting, and a great storyline. I try hard to find some fault or other with this lovely piece of filming, but cannot. Julie Andrews does what I consider to be her best ever work. And those children, who can possibly forget them?Please people, do yourselves a favor. Watch this movie, and watch it again. Never forget it, and do not place silly movies above it.\n",

      "Review Text: I love this movie!!!  The acting is wonderful and the music is beautiful, but those aren't the only things I love about it.  One of the reasons I watch this movie again and again is because I simply adore seeing the love between Maria and Captain Von Trapp unfold.  From the stern, cold way he addresses her in the beginning to his deep sincerity when he tells Maria that he loves her, the whole development is nothing short of magical.  The children are all wonderful, considering (and I checked up on this!) that each of them were really about 3-5 years older than the ages they portrayed! Since I've seen the movie so many times, I've noticed a few picky little editing mistakes, but that hardly matters considering the great feeling one experiences while watching this classic.\n",

Julie Andrews is amazing as Maria and Christopher Plummer as dashing and debonair as ever as the Captain VonTrapp. The kids are funny and mischievous as they at first try to run Maria out of her governess position only to be won over by the sound of music.The cinematography is fantastic as it was back in the days of the pure art of making a movie and a Roger and Hammerstein story as well. This movie is the equivalent of drinking a warm cup of tea or a hot cup of chocolate during the cold winter days.And its a phuck Nazi story as well which really wraps up its perfection.

      "Review Text: This movie... is very strange. The first half is absolutely iconic, with great songs, a decent concept for a story, and pretty great acting, which is especially impressive when you remember that the majority of the characters are kids. But the second half of the film kind of drops the musical fantasy element, and it suddenly becomes a story about the main character falling in love and then having the escape from being killed by Nazis. This sounds awesome but its actually really boring.The first half is good, most of the songs are really well performed, and remain classics to this day. Except \"16 going on 17\" that song is just... weird, and not really entertaining. The second half of the movie features a song from the head nun of Maria's church, and its by far the least memorable song in the film, and that is when you realize that this movie is no longer going to be entertaining.And then we get to the third act... and dear lord it is weird. Maria marries the Captain, and then the two of them must flee the country with his children in order to escape being killed by Nazis. This comes out of nowhere, and despite how interesting it might sound, it completely goes against the tone that the first half of the film set up, and most people will turn it off once they get to this point because it lacks the entertainment value that the beginning of the movie was able to provide so well.5/10 Just watch the songs on YouTube.\n",

But, at the same time it also shows us an enjoyable story and story line to follow along with making it much easier for younger generations of viewers to fully grasp what is going on.

      "Review Text: I like using movies for teaching English in Asia. I show them as an adjunct to English class, so that students get an extended chance to hear English in use.The Sound of Music is too fast for my lower level students at the beginning of the year, but by the end of their first year, it's good. The accent is very clear, and the subtitles on the DVD are fairly accurate but not exact at all. However, since it is very long, it has to be shown in three to five sessions. If you try to show it in one long session your students will fall asleep. (Remember how difficult it is to listen for extended periods to a language that you struggle in).I didn't find an accurate script online so I downloaded one, corrected it roughly, and made a vocabulary list. I'm sure many English teachers would appreciate suggestions from other ESL teachers about how to use this movie for teaching English, or specific activities.\n",

And the fact that the movie depicts that she was truly in love with him and just in denial about it at first, really is one of the worst lies ever. There's always been so much confusion on dating and marriage, and this is one issue, which I feel, many people don't seem to understand is actually very bad. This deception is very unacceptable!\n",

It's a colorful musical, a beautiful love story, and, above all, a testimony in support of standing up for your convictions and to the ability of music to move the soul and change lives. Julie Andrews is at her best, both as an actress and a singer.  To think that if she had gotten the lead in My Fair Lady, like she deserved, she probably would have never played Maria!  Christopher Plummer is wonderful as the stern, but big-hearted Captain von Trapp. There's no one I love to hate more than Eleanor Parker's scheming, snobbish Baroness.  Plus, the talent of Mother Abbess and all the children never fail to amaze me: \"Climb Every Mountain\" gives me goose bumps and I always love watching the children perform \"Do-re-mi\".  Finally, the two main Sisters and their \"sin\" brings a clever touch of humor to a serious scene. All in all, this film has rightly become a cherished part of American cinema.  A true feel-good movie that no household should be without.\n",

However when I find that footman at the embassy ball to call each one of the guest's name such as \"Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering. Professor Higgins\" is \"Herr Zeller\",I am shocked. And the Hungarian \"Karpathy\" is Theodore Bikel, who acts Captain von Trapp at the stage in 1959 or so. This make me feel........ Well, His figure is quite different from Christopher Plummer and when i hear his actually singing Edelweiss in CD i am nearly dizzy. Of course Mr Plummer's was dubbed and I am quite used to Bill Lee's. I don't know whether Mr Plummer's real voice is better than Bill Lee, but actually I don't like Theodore Bikel's singing, and, his flat figure.\n",

      "Review Text: this is definitely the greatest musical of all time but that still makes it less fun to watch than mortal kombat:annihalation seven times in a row. I have never been much of a fan of musicals, but this film...... does nothing to change my opinion. If you like musicals watch, if not head for the hills, alive or not. As usual Julia Andrews' acting performance is flawless...definitley comparable to a similar role in her other blockbusting and cultural film...Mary Poppins.Seriously though, unless u are a massive fan of musicals (and i mean MASSIVE) avoid this film at all costs. Yes its well made but so is a korean supermini.\n",

      "Review Text: \"The Hill's fill my heart with The Sound Of Music!\" The incredible classic, \"The Sound of Music\" is truly my favorite movie of all time. The music, the story, the laughs; all amazing! Maria, played by Julie Andrews, is sent into the lived to Captain Von Trapp,played by Chistopher Plummer, and his seven children to act as a governess. However, she becomes a friend,a teacher, and even....nope, you'll have to see the movie to find out for yourself. Maria brings the children a joy which many of them had never known, the joy of Music. Will uplifting songs, breathtaking scenery, and hilarious memories to last a lifetime, \"The Sound Of Music\" is truly a must-see for every generation.\n",

A family of singers runs from the Nazi's, and every few minutes they stop to sing about their \"Favorite things\" or how \"the hills are alive with the sound of music.\" If I were running from the Nazi's, I wouldn't stop to sing every two seconds about the stupid hills! If this is based on a true story, then I'm the Queen of England.Score: Not even 0, it doesn't deserve that many points. It owes us points, that's how bad it is.\n",

      "Review Text: People will always watch the films that they are fond of several times, so do I. Just like this one ---The sound of music, which is known to all the world. Really I love it so much that I cannot remember how many times I watch it. Maria, such a pretty and kind name and person for me now, is a tutor, but she love hr student just like her children and give them almost all her love. To free them and bring them out to the nature. She ignores the chitin¡¯s military management on the children, which at last makes leave. Yes, she can do what she like, never gives up or accepts other¡¯s will, even it will make her bad. She distinguishes right from wrong and understand how to maintain her rules .at last, she gains her reputation in the children and the trust and love of the chaptin. It is certain that what the classic is the well-known songs in it, which seems universal. If you ask me how do I think of the music in it, of course I love it. Why not? I cannot help doing so, including the whole movie.\n",

      "Review Text: This movie has something magical in the sense that you could watch it over and over again without ever getting bored. Its powerful and compelling from beginning to end. The best thing about this movie is of course the songs; they have so much meaning and are perfect to the atmosphere in the movie at the time they are heard. The highlight is no doubt when Mother Superior sings 'Climb Every Mountain'. There is so much poignancy involved in that song that you begin to cry, laugh and just be stunned by the song at the same time. The only low point of this movie comes from Christopher Plummer's acting and especially his singing which lacks the quality of the other singers in the movie. If anyone's ever told you that this is an amazing movie, they couldn't be more right about it. Be prepared to experience many emotions in one movie.\n",

In a span of almost three hours, you get to see a short tour of Austria and learn a great deal about the Von Trapp Family.  The songs are so unforgettable, that you will find yourself singing along throughout the entire film.  The Sound Of Music is a musical that will, probably, never be matched.  I highly recommend The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins.  As with The Sound Of Music, you will find yourself singing all the way through.\n",

Julie Andrews has an amazing voice and stage presence. Plus, she can act. I recently saw some clips from some Broadway shows she was in and she's amazing in that too. She plays the roles so well that I almost forget it's Julie Andrews playing a character, because she is such a skilled actress. Christopher Plumber is also great. My favorite song from the movie is probably Something Good, but I also really like Edelweiss. I'll continue to watch Sound of Music until I die.\n",

Some of the worst parts of this movie (if there were any) are better than the best parts of modern films (SHE'S ALL THAT and EVER AFTER come to mind!) and redifined the movie musical.Julie Andrews should be given her much-deserved academy award (she was beaten by the unknown Julie Christie in 1965 [Ha! big mistake!]) and then everyone would be happy.\n",

One of my favourite scenes is actually the dinner table scene when all the children and the Captain are sitting at the table and Maria sits on the pine cone. I thought the food in this scene looked absolutely delicious. It took me a while to figure out but after looking and looking I realized that the food in my favorite dinner scene is actually just mashed potatoes with stuffed ham rolls and lettuce with dishes of croissants on the table and glasses of water. It still looks very tasty. Overall this is an excellent movie to stay at home any night alone or with others and watch. It is extremely entertaining and the songs are really great.\n",

It's just a wonderful escapist film with no offensive language, no violence and no prejudice. It is a light hearted and lovely film set in beautiful surroundings with songs to fill your heart. People berate it everywhere and that is because they have not bothered to watch it and understand it. It's not realistic in the sense that people don't burst into song in the streets no, but it is quite lovely to watch with your family.It is no coincidence that this film has transcended all generations and boundaries and will never die. Long may it go on and my daughter already loves it too :-)I would urge all families to show it to their children. You can take from it whatever you wish. those who berate it are usually the ones who would rather watch Terminator or get pleasure from watching people having their heads mashed to a pulp by a tattooed Neanderthal in a string vest...\n",

The Sound of Music really is enchanting. It's about love in all aspects. It's just beautiful,and Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer have great chemistry on screen. It is now my favorite movie and probably will be for the rest of my life. There are moments in this movie that just touch my heart. Like when the Captain connects w/ his children through music and also the scene in the gazebo w/ Maria and the Captain. Also the music is amazing! It has a fabulous score put together by Rogers and Hammerstein. See this movie! It is wonderful!\n",

      "Review Text: Based in Austria during the 1930's, The Sound of Music is about a girl Maria (Julie Andrews) who has a deep desire to become a nun. However, Maria has an aptitude for getting herself in trouble, and is therefore ordered to work as a governess for Navy captain Georg Von Trapp. The seven Von Trapp family children have scared away their past governesses, mainly due to their pranks and rudeness. Eventually, Maria wins the affection of the unhappy children as well as the strict captain. The once hostile household becomes one of laughter, kindness, and—of course—singing.Though The Sound of Music is a timeless love story, it is riddled with danger and suspense. Captain Von Trapp refuses to join the ranks of Nazii Germany, and his family is put in harms way as they attempt to evade the injustices of their country. Captain Von Trapp is considered a traitor by his ranks, but he is determined to do all he can to keep his family safe.\n",

      "Review Text: SPOILER!!!!! The movie The Sound of Music is a great introduction to singing as well as a heart-warming tear-jerker. Maria (Julie Andrews) is a young nun who just can't stop leaving the Abbey to sing freely in the mountains. Soon the other nuns of the Abbey decide something must be done about Maria through the humorous song 'How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?' Maria is then sent off to be the governess of the seven von Trapp children including the oldest, Liesl (played by Charmian Carr)(16) all the way down to five year-old Gretl (played by Kym Karath). The children play harmless pranks on Maria before they get to know her, but after she comforts them all during a fierce thunderstorm with her song 'My Favorite Things' they begin to warm up to her and soon the children and Maria have a bond that cannot be broken. She takes them to a picnic and teaches them all to sing again, something that has been banned by Captain von Trapp (played by Christopher Plummer) after his wife died, in the delightfully simple song 'Do-Re-Me.'The movie follows as Maria flees back to the Abbey after the Baroness informs Maria that she is in love. The children get her to come back by tracking her down at the Abbey. Finding that he is, indeed, in love with Maria, Captain von Trapp calls off his wedding with the Baroness, making you just want to cheer. Maria is soon married to the captain and mother of the children she has come to love when the Germans start invading. They are forcing the captain to command ships in the war, his old profession. Not wanting to help the enemies the von Trapps must think of something quick. So they are off to sing in a festival and, back-stage they escape and hide in the Abbey that has sheltered Maria. The nuns' loving nature welcomes them in. As they are hiding in the cemetery you will be leaning on the edge of your seat and laughing as the nuns confess 'Mother, we have sinned,' while holding up stolen car parts that make the Germans cars unable to run to catch the von Trapps. Without cars, the family goes by foot into the mountains to escape to Switzerland, a neutral territory where they will be safe. The movie closes as the von Trapps are climbing high in the mountains, over the border, singing all the way.\n",

    "Here we uses Matplotlib to generate a 2x2 grid of histograms, each representing a different sentiment score (negative, neutral, positive, compound) derived from the 'scored_reviews' dataset. Each histogram shows the distribution of scores within their respective sentiment category. The 'bins=20' parameter sets the number of bins in each histogram, providing a visualization of how sentiment scores are distributed across different sentiments. The 'tight_layout()' function optimizes the spacing between subplots for better readability, and 'plt.show()' displays the generated plot. This visualization helps to understand the frequency or count of sentiment scores in each sentiment category."

    "## **Automated Extraction of IMDb Movie Reviews Using Selenium WebDriver**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to automate the process of extracting movie reviews from the IMDb website and perform sentiment analysis on the collected data. By leveraging Python libraries such as Selenium WebDriver, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, pandas, and Matplotlib, this project streamlines the extraction of user reviews, analyzes sentiment, and visualizes sentiment trends for the movie \"The Sound of Music.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selenium Initialization**:\n",
    "The project begins by initializing a Chrome WebDriver using the Selenium library. The WebDriver is directed to the IMDb page for \"The Sound of Music\" reviews (specifically, the URL: **`https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/reviews?ref_=tt_urv`**).\n",
    "2. **Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup**:\n",
    "After opening the IMDb reviews page, the BeautifulSoup library is utilized to parse the HTML content. The script identifies and extracts crucial information from individual review containers on the webpage. This includes the reviewer's name, review date, and review text for each review available on the page.\n",
    "3. **Sentiment Analysis using VADER**:\n",
    "The NLTK library's VADER sentiment analysis tool is employed to perform sentiment analysis on the extracted reviews. VADER assigns sentiment scores for negativity, neutrality, positivity, and an overall compound score to each review. These scores provide an insight into the sentiment expressed in each review.\n",
    "4. **Data Structuring with Pandas**:\n",
    "The sentiment analysis results are structured into a pandas DataFrame named **`scored_reviews`**. This DataFrame organizes the reviewer names, review dates, review texts, and sentiment scores (negative, neutral, positive, compound) in a tabular format for easy analysis and manipulation.\n",
    "5. **Visualizing Sentiment Trends**:\n",
    "To better understand sentiment trends over time, the project computes the mean compound sentiment score per year using the **`scored_reviews`** DataFrame. This information is visualized through a bar chart generated with Matplotlib, illustrating sentiment changes over different years based on the analyzed reviews.\n",
    "6. **Sentiment Distribution Visualization**:\n",
    "Additionally, the project creates histograms using Matplotlib to showcase the distribution of negative, neutral, positive, and compound sentiment scores. These visualizations aid in understanding the frequency and distribution of sentiment scores within their respective categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the automation of data extraction from web sources, sentiment analysis of textual data, and visualization of sentiment trends. By combining Selenium WebDriver for web scraping, NLTK for sentiment analysis, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib, it provides a comprehensive analysis of IMDb movie reviews for \"The Sound of Music.\"\n",
